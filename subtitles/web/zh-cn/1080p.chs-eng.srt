不能先把雷管接上

170
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,650
否则有可能意外引爆
so you don't accidentally detonate your charge.

你还要记得...

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,080
然后用手握住你的雷管
And then you wanna take your hands and the cap

174
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,000
放入目标地点

00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,400
你看
I mean...

285
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,050
我知道
I see it.

286
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,780
那一套白人中产
A White-bred,

287
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,570
市侩庸俗 恶心透顶的公司文化
philistine, asshole corporate culture,

288
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,030
它唯一的目的
whose only end

289
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,830
就是打更多广告 捞更多钱
is to perfect the science of advertising.

290
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:22,910
我跟你说实话
But I ain't gonna hold ya, bitch.

291
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,210
他要是敢对我不好
If he treats me different after I drop

292
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,670
等这个小东西从我肚子里爬出来
this motherfucker thing inside my stomach, bitch,

293
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,710
我可不忍着 你看我宰了他

294
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,920
宝贝 别这样
Bae, stop.

295
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,110
看我敢不敢
I'll kill him dead!

296
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,770
趁他还没打倒我
Before he beats me!

297
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,430
说什么呢 姐们儿？
What the fuck? That...

298
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,600
她好像不知道自己怀孕了一样
It's like she doesn't even realize she's pregnant.

299
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,100
那就是孩子爸爸 长得跟其他白巧克力一样
Some other white chocolate daddy over there and all this shit.

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,940
{\an8}【白巧克力爹：俚语 黑人妻子讥讽性称呼白人丈夫】

301
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,770
说得对
You right.

302
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,820
你知道我的意思吧？
You feel me? No...

303
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,670
就是这样 拿起一个 放下去
Okay, so put one up and down.

304
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,310
好的
Okay.

305
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,760
对 这就是说 我是庄家
Okay, so that means...I'm the house.

306
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,810
你和我女儿一点都不般配
You know, you are so unsuitable for my daughter.

307
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,020
我？
Me?

308
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,180
对 你
Yeah, you.

309
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,480
真可笑
And that's hilarious.

310
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,460
我不...
I don't...

311
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,670
我女儿来自的家族 几代人都是革命者
My child comes from a whole line of revolutionaries.

312
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,300
而你一脸茫然
And you look so lost.

313
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,900
她大步向前 你却沉溺当下
She's a runner, and you a stump.

314
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,690
这孩子你打算怎么办？
What are you gonna do about this baby? Hm?

315
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,310
我只是想被人看见 还有
No, I just, I wanna feel seen and...

316
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,610
被人爱 被欣赏
loved and appreciated.

317
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,690
我怀孩子整整九个月
I fuckin' carried her nine months.

318
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,080
现在他却整天只知道围着宝宝转
And now he can just, gets to fuckin' walk around...

319
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,050
看见孩子就开心得不得了
and just swoonin' all fuckin' day.

320
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,960
就好像 他只爱女儿一个人
It's like she's his only girl.

321
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,500
我就是空气 是一块肉
Like, I just no longer exist. I'm just a fuckin' piece of meat.

322
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,170
有时候我觉得自己疯了
And sometimes, I feel crazy,

323
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,010
我居然会嫉妒自己的宝宝 这正常吗？
'cause I'm just like...am I weird for being jealous of my baby?

324
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,260
我感觉没人关心我 没人爱我
I don't fuckin' feel seen. I don't feel love.

325
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,560
我肯定变丑了
I feel fuckin' ugly.

326
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,920
我的胸口疼 我几乎都没有奶水了
My nipples hurt. I can barely fucking produce milk.

327
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,250
我…
You know, I...

328
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,680
我感觉糟透了
I'm not okay.

329
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,740
亲爱的 你大晚上去哪儿？
Baby, where do you think you're goin', huh?

330
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,380
穿成这样上哪儿去？
Where you goin' like that?

331
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,460
别跟我说话 我想去哪儿就去哪儿
Stop talkin' to me. I go as I please.

332
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,480
你看我们都成家了
You realize that we're a family now, right?

333
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,010
用不着闹革命了
You don't have to do this anymore.

334
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,970
你知道我说过 我为自己而活
You realize I put myself first, right?

335
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,730
你就是害怕这一点
And that's what you scared of.

336
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,360
我们都有孩子了 总不会忘了吧？
We have her now. You do get that, right?

337
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,330
首先 我为自己活 其次 你的话老掉牙了
I put myself first, and I reject your lack of originality.

338
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,810
天啊 说我老掉牙
God, my lack of originality.

339
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,200
请你不要再胡扯了好吗？
Will you stop with all this bullshit?

340
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,190
别再闹了 你和我成家了
Would you stop it? We're a goddamn family.

341
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,480
你有责任照顾孩子
You have her to take care of.

342
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,730
你以为你还能去哪儿？
Where the hell do you think you're goin'?

343
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,670
好啦 宝宝
It's okay, baby.

344
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,080
没事的 不哭了
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

345
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,610
宝宝不哭 没事的
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

346
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,050
不要给我灌输你的想法
This is a new consciousness.

347
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,440
我的想法？
New consciousness?

348
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,390

我也不是你妈
I'm not your mother.

351
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,480
你想要掌控我
You want your power over me,

352
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,820
就像你们男人总想掌控一切
The same reason you want your power over the world.

353

你和你那玻璃心的大男子主义
You and your crumblin' male ego...

354
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,640
永远不会成为这场革命的战友
Will never do this revolution like me.

355
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,350
所以请滚出我的房子
Fuck outta here.

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,550
看得出来
You can tell that she actually

562
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,720
她是真心想做一个好学生

563
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,450
她每天来学校都活力十足
She enters class each day ready to work,

564
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,390

其他学生都很佩服她
The other students really admire her, um...

566
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,470
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

567
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,700
我这眼泪只是...
If I get emotional, it's just um...

568
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,520
喜极而泣
Tears of joy, that's all.

569
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,680

我能看出你现在很激动
I see this is very emotional for you.

571
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,310
我不知道
I don't know...

572
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,470
说实话 薇拉一直没有妈妈
You know, Willa grew up without her mom.

573
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,500
她妈妈在她很小的时候死了
Her mom died when she was very young.

574
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,520
是这样啊
Oh. I see.

575
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,880
薇拉从没见过妈妈？
So Willa never knew her mother?

576
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,950
没有 从来没见过
No. She never did.

577
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,230
这姑娘太不容易了
That can be very hard on a young woman.

578
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,410
（警告 围栏已通电）

我女儿要结婚 大家都穿着礼服

604
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,880
我完全理解 先生
Perfectly understandable, sir.

605
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,440
请坐吧
Please, sit.

606
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,700
尚恩·米切尔向你问好
Shane Mitchell sends a hello.

607
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,060
尚恩老大 他还在建车库吗？

608
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,040
我看他永远都建不完
The construction project that never ends.

609
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,110
总会完工的 请您替我带个好
I'm sure he'll get it done. Will you give him my best?

610

611
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,880
从里奥杜尔特过来顺利吗？
How was your journey from Rio Duarte?

612
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,860
很顺利

614
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,080
谢谢您 先生
Thank you very much, sir.

615
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,290
移民就像汹涌的潮水
Each and every day is hand-to-hand combat

616
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,590
每天都是一场硬仗 对吗？
in the spread of uncontrolled migration, isn't it?

617
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,630
您说得没错
Yes, it is, sir.

618
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,500
是啊
Yeah.

619
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:51,060
有人说“解决移民 拯救地球”
Well, "You wanna save the planet, you start with immigration."

620
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,030
完全正确 先生
That's exactly right, sir.

621
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,910
这是你说的
You said that.

622
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,830
几年前卧石行动结束后说的
A few years back, after Squatting Pebble.

623
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,950
我听说你对我们感兴趣
I understand you've expressed an interest in us.

624
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,050
是 先生
Yes, sir, I have.

625
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,010
你是不是很荣幸
And does it honor you

626
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,890
能被提名加入我们的俱乐部？
to be considered for membership in our club?

627
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,630
我深感荣幸 先生
It's a very deep honor, sir.

628
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,890
当然是这样
Yes, it is.

629
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,870
史蒂文 我们在过去几年呢
Steve, we have, in the past,

630
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:22,290
招募了一些军方成员加入俱乐部
Offered membership to certain members of the military.

631
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,020
我们发现他们的
We found their...

632
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:28,040
实战经验和专业战术相当有用
Tactical battlefield expertise to be quite useful.

633
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,650
你看 我们和你的目标是一致的
Now, our aim and your aim is the same.

634
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,630
及时发现危险的疯子 恨国者
To find dangerous lunatics, haters

635
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,870
地痞流氓 及时制止
And punk trash and stop them.

636
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,720
再也不会有人闹事
No more lunatics.

637
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,820
我不知道你有没有听说
Now, I'm not sure if you've heard or not,

638
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,100
吉姆·克林格去世了
but Jim Kringle passed away.

639
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,490
{\an8}【克林格：意为耶稣小孩 为英语中圣诞老人的别称】

640
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,360
我听到了消息
Oh, I did hear that, yes.

641
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,130
俱乐部有空缺了
This means an opening.

642
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:56,530
上校 我可以毫不夸张地说
Colonel, I don't think I'm being immodest when I say

643
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,220
如果能够加入圣诞先驱俱乐部
that joining the Christmas Adventurers Club

644
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,210
你就正式成为了高尚的人
means that you are a superior man.

645
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,190
你不是最优秀 最聪明的人
No, not the best man, not the most intelligent,

646
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,320
也不是最见多识广和智慧的人
The most sophisticated, or the wisest.

647
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,150
你只是比其他人更优越 更高尚
It just means that you are superior to other human beings,

648
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,870
当然你会得到财富 交到最好的朋友
And you shall never want for riches or the greatest of friends.

649
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:22,480
我们是独立运作 行事也可以机动灵活
Now, we report to ourselves with a freedom to be creative

650
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,000
省略一些繁琐的程序
and cut through layers of bureaucracy.

651
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,190
我们信奉金科玉律
We live by the Golden Rule,

652
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:30,110
目标是与志同道合的伙伴们一起
in a network of like-minded men and women

653
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,480
让世界变得更安全 更纯净
dedicated to makin' the world safe and pure.

654
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,490
如果有人认为
What would you say to someone who believes

655
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,120
你在种族净化行动中
that you have been soft

656
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,490
表现出软弱动摇 你会怎么说？
in your duty to racial purification?

657
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,110
我会说
I would say

658
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,900
说这样话的人不配活在社会上
they are a liar who has no business in society.

659
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,650
也不配活在地球上
Or on the planet, for that matter. Mm.

660
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,550
你现在有配偶吗？
Do you presently live with a spouse?

661
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,710
没有
No, sir.

662
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:57,060
你有没有因为心理健康问题 咨询过医生？
Have you ever consulted with a mental health professional?

663
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,760
没有
No, sir.

664
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,330
你有没有拖欠债务
Have you ever had any bills or debts

665
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,640
被人追债？
turned over to a collection agency?

666
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,940
我买过一辆水上摩托
Well, I did purchase a jet ski.

667
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,150
是悄羽蜂速238那个型号的升级款
It was an evolution of the old Hummingbird Whisperdoo 238.

668
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,610
叫做疾爆海豚335
Called the Dynamite Dolphin 335.

669
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,570
它性能有缺陷
It was defective.

670
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:15,410
我就拒绝了付款 但我一点也不后悔
I abstained from payment. I'd do it again. I have no regrets.

671
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,300
好的
Okay.

672
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,630
你有没有公开参与过
Have you ever knowingly engaged

673
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,150
任何针对美国的恐怖活动？
in any acts of terrorism against this country?

674
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,580
没有
No, sir.

675
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,320
你有没有经历过跨种族的恋爱关系？
Have you ever engaged in an interracial relationship?

676
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,200
没有
No, sir.

677
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,970
你是美国出生的非犹太人？
And you are American-born by gentile?

678
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,820
是的
Yes, sir.

679
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,560
有一点我要说清楚
Now, to avoid any misunderstanding,

680
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,430
你申请加入俱乐部期间
we require absolute secrecy

681
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,390
必须对此事完全保密
through the initiation process

682
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,020
这是为了测试你的无私和忠诚
to judge how serious and unselfish you are.

683
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,730
- 明白吗？ - 嗯
- You understand? - Mm-hmm.

684
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,390
另外 想要成为候选成员
And to be considered to a vote,

685
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:57,040
你必须自愿接受一项背景审查
you must submit to a voluntary vulnerability study.

686
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,640
用来查明你个人可能有的任何问题
This identifies anything problematic in your character.

687
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,740
我能有什么问题吗？
What could be a problem?

688
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,800
我不知道
I don't know.

689
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,530
你有问题吗？
What could be a problem?

690
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,280
绝对不会有
Absolutely nothing.

691
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,360
我们需要了解你是否可靠
We wanna know who we're standing with.

692
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,170
当然
Sure.

693
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,670
审查是由

00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,210
宗审委员会做的全套纯血美国白人背景审查
It's a Double Yankee White Inquisitions Completum.

695
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,630
所以 如果你怀疑自己的
So if you have any doubt as to your ability

696
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,220
身体和品格无法胜任
to qualify in body or character

697
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,390
圣诞先驱俱乐部成员一职
as a member of the Christmas Adventurers Club,

698

有几千拉丁裔

849
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,300
当地的居民很可能
Expect the local populace to be

850

会同情 甚至包庇
sympathetic and supportive

Where, what?

857
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,000
宝贝 你也不帮我热一下
This isn't even warm, sweetie.

858

你去哪儿了？
Where were you?

859
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:12,340

我特地告诉过你我去了哪儿
Well, I specifically told you where I was.

862

你问过我 我也回答了你
You asked me that. I told you where I was.

863

是我们以前爱听的乐队 记得吗？
You remember our old band, right?

865
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,930
就是他们 正常街区外
The old band, sweetie. A Block Past Normal.

866
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,310
记得艾伯特吗？
You remember Albert?

867
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:30,210

艾伯特买了一些旧设备

都是史提利·丹乐队的录音室用过的
from Steely Dan's old studio

871
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:39,070
{\an8}【史提利·丹乐队：1970年代美国摇滚与爵士融合乐队】

872
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,110
他买下这些就是为了玩复古
to try to get that sort of vintage, you know,

873
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,610
追求所谓的真空管音色
that sort of crackling tube sound.

874
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,280
现在谁要听这种东西？
You don't need any of that stuff anymore.

875
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,200
他还买了个电脑软件
He brought out a computer program.

876
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,160
说是只要按一下按钮
Boom, with the press of a button--

877
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,140
你怎么回家的？
How'd you get home?

878
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,570
什么意思？
What do you mean?

879
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:51,600
你怎么回家的？
How did you get home?

880
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,330
我开车回来的
Well, with my car.

881
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:54,700
醉驾了？
You drove?

882
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,420
怎么？难道你是我的保姆吗？
So what are you, my babysitter? What, what, what...

883
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,010
对啊
Yeah.

884
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:02,090
我会喝酒 也会开车 我能照顾好自己
I know how to drink and drive, honey. I know what I'm doin'.

885
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,680

干吗？
What?

888
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:07,470
说呀
What?

889
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:08,680
我也不想当你的保姆
I don't wanna be your babysitter.

890
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,960
我不想天天操心你有没有
I don't wanna worry if you wrapped

891
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,230
把车撞到电线杆子上
your cararound a telephone pole.

892
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:11,940
我没有撞到电线...
Well, I didn't wrap my--

893
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,100
我不是这个意思
I didn't ask for this.

894
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,730
可我怎么躺上这种事情？
That's just how the cards were rolled out for me.

895
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:15,590
不对
It's...

896
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,110
是摊上
It's "dice," sweetie.

897
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:18,780
什么？
What?

898
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,400
不是躺上这种事 是摊上这种事
It's not "cards." You don't roll cards. It's dice.

899
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,240
滚一边去 鲍勃
Fuck off, Bob.

900
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,660
别再扯这些了 好吗？
Just fuck off with that, okay?

901
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,880
成熟点儿
Grow up.

902
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,270
好吧
Wow. Okay.

903
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,460
我想说 你能表达自己的观点
Well, you... Look. I like the way you're standin' up for yourself.

904
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,250
这样非常好
I'm proud of ya, honey,

905
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:34,710
但是有时候
but the way you, uh,

906
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:37,460
你对你爸说话的方式有点...
Speak to your father sometimes, it's just...

907
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:39,590
你说得也对
I don't know. You're right.

908
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:41,880
以后多跟我坦诚相待
You should tell me what you think, always.

909
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,380
任何事情都不要瞒我
Never hold anything back from me.

910
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,350
你到底是有什么毛病？
What the fuck is wrong with you?

911
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:47,930
说得对 我得记住 我这人有毛病
You're right. That's somethin' I gotta remember.

912
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:50,970
时不时还会搞砸事情
And I fuck up sometimes.

913
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,100
谁来了？
Whoa. Who's this?

914
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,370
那是谁？
Who's that?

915
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,480
是什么人？
Who is that?

916
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,870
只是我的朋友
They're just my friends.

917
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:00,650
朋友？
And they just,

918
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,950
还开个红色的车
They have a red car like that, just drivin'...

919
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,240
太张扬了吧？
Little loud, don't you think?

920
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,280
一辆车而已
It's just a car.

921
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,240
- 是你让他们开过来的？ - 对
- And you told 'em they could do that? - Yes.

922
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,240
到我们家门口？
Told 'em to come to the house?

923
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:08,970
怎么了
Yes!

924
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:10,690
那个涂口红的是谁？
Now, who's the one with the lipstick?

925
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:12,630
叫什么名字？
What's that one's name?

926
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:13,410
波波
Bobo.

927
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:15,820
波波 这是男的？女的？还是别的什么性别？
Bobo. Now, is that a he or a she or a they?

928
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,790
行了 老爸
Dad, come on.

929
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:18,540
我只是想知道 这位是在性别过渡还是…
No, are they transitioning? I wanna know if...

930
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,590
人家是是非二元性别
They're nonbinary.

931
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:24,260
{\an8}【非二元性别：不完全认同传统男女二元分类的性别身份】

932
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:21,340
好吧 我只是想确定一下称呼
Okay, I just wanna be polite. All right.

933
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,260
没什么好确定的 用中性词
It's not that hard! "They, them."

934
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,680
门口那个臭小子又是谁？
And who's this little fuckin' freak at the door?

935
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,640
大概是布罗托
Probably Bluto.

936
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,970
就这样登门的？
They're just comin' to my house like this, huh?

937
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:28,720
怎么了？
Yes!

938
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,350
没事
All right.

939
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:31,020

940
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,500
- 是我朋友 - 好吧

947
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,990
那就放在吊袜带里面好了
Put it in your garter or whatever you got.

948
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:48,240
谁还穿吊袜带？

955
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:56,670
你平时敲别人家门都是这么大声吗？
You normally knock that loud at somebody's house like that?

956
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:58,570
- 是 - 耐心等着
- Uh, yeah. - Yeah, give us a sec, homie.

可以放在...你带包吗？
Put it in... You got a purse?

958
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:02,380
你必须拿上它
This is non-negotiable!

959
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,300
放在你包里

我们正探讨自由呢
We're talkin' about freedom, baby.

我们在探讨自由
We're talkin' about freedom.

978
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:28,610
自由这东西真怪

Why didn't she tell me she has a phone?

1366
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,070
也许她不想惹你生气
Maybe she didn't want you to get mad.

1367
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:40,600
她就不该有手机

我带来个孩子 薇拉·弗格森

真不敢相信
Unbelievable.

01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,450
我和我妈长得像吗？
Do I look just like her?

1823

不
No.

我们这里有规矩 要想住在这儿

每个人都要承担责任

别问我无线网络密码是什么
And don't ask for the fuckin' Wi-Fi,

1847
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:10,750
这儿没有无线网络
'cause we ain't got none.

1848
01:33:10,770 --> 01:33:12,850
好好休息吧 大小姐
Make yourself at home, Goldilocks.

1849
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:22,570
她知道多少？
What does she know?

1850
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:26,610
她以为她母亲是英雄
She thinks her mom was a hero.

1851
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:28,960
我有点儿...
And I...

1852
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,790
不忍心告诉她真相
I didn't have the guts to tell her the truth.

1853
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:37,170

本来就够难了
Shit's hard enough.

1858

Tim, I'm gonna get right to it. Um...

1923
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:05,320

混了哪个人种？
Which mix?

1927
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,340
我真的难以启齿 但是
There's no real easy way to say this, but...

1928
01:37:21,850 --> 01:37:23,180
好吧
Yeah.

1929

是黑的
It's Black.

1930
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,530
天啊
Well, uh...

1931
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:37,410
这件事如果是真的
That would be quite the revelation

1932
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,730
那就太可怕了
if it were true.

1933
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,730
比尔 请问这消息哪儿来的？
Bill, may I ask what your source is?

1934

来自纯血美国白人背景审查报告
Sure. That's part of a Double Yankee White background check.

So where's the Pussy?

1941
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:09,430
她早就死了
Oh, she's long dead.

01:38:15,490 --> 01:38:18,160
在埃尔帕索抓走了一个平民
to make a civilian extraction in El Paso.

1946
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,650
带队的是阿威腾·魁 你认识吗？
It was led by an Avanti Q. You know him?

1947
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:24,020
认识 阿威腾是个好军人
Yeah, I know Avanti. He's a good soldier.

1948
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:25,270
有多好？
Not great?

1949
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:28,030
很不错 可惜他不是白人
I mean, he's excellent, but he's not a native son.

1950
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:30,450
这是他的肮脏小秘密
That's his dirty little secret.

1951
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:34,700
他假装是半个墨西哥人 其实有印第安血统
He passes for half-Mexican, but he's actually part Comanche

1952
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:35,690
还是爱斯基摩人血统
or, I don't know, Eskimo.

1953
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:37,920
他很擅长追踪
He's a fantastic tracker.

1954
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:41,330
光看脚印 他就知道对方口袋里有多少钱
He'll tell you how much money someone had in their pocket based on a footprint,

1955
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:44,410
但他不是白人 所以不可信
but he is not homegrown, so I would not trust it.

1956
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:47,190
不过 显然他有足够的本事
Yeah, well, he's apparently good enough

1957
01:38:47,210 --> 01:38:49,260
找到勒喉乔一直想找的人
to find what Lockjaw was lookin' for.

1958
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:53,410
没错 他找到了霍华德·萨默威尔
Yeah. He found Howard Sommerville.

1959
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:58,310
前法式七五成员 现在运营一个地下组织
Ex-French 75. He runs an underground railroad,

1960
01:38:58,330 --> 01:39:00,850
将非法移民从南方边境
bringing illegals from our southern border

1961
01:39:00,870 --> 01:39:02,520
带去北方的归援十字市
to Baktan Cross in the north,

1962
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:05,360
把那儿变成了庇护城市
where he set up a so-called sanctuary city,

1963
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:08,700
帮助毒贩和神经病在美国扎根
giving jobs and housing to drug dealers and psychopaths.

1964
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:11,400
他还是一个瘾君子
He's also a reefer addict.

1965
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:14,170
真的？这么说他还挺有能耐的
Really? Well, he sounds like a class act, this guy.

1966
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:15,340
抓走他之后
Next thing we know,

1967
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:19,080
勒喉乔上校的特遣队 进入了归援十字市
Colonel Lockjaw's mobilized his task force into Baktan Cross

1968
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:21,370
对香香鸡速冻食品厂
and conducted a Class-A raid

1969
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,860
进行了最高等级突袭
on the Chicken Lickin' Frozen Farm.

1970
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:27,180
哦不 我很喜欢他们家的鸡块
Oh, no. I love their nuggets.

1971
01:39:27,490 --> 01:39:30,370
是吗？暂时可能买不到了
Well, this could mean a nugget shortage.

1972
01:39:31,150 --> 01:39:34,520
更何况 厂长也是我们俱乐部的成员
Not to mention the Chicken Lickin's owned by our fellow Christmas Adventurer,

1973
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:39,110
他希望那些拉丁狗非法劳工 能快点复工
Brother Burt Rimhorn, who wants his wetbacks back to work.

1974
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:40,100
接着说
Next...

1975
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:42,020
他还搜查了高中 提姆
He hit the high school, Tim.

1976
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:42,900
没错
Yeah.

1977
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:44,960
是那所高中
The high school.

1978
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,480
现在归援十字市已经乱成一锅粥了
And now, all hell's broken loose on the streets of Baktan Cross.

1979
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,530
他还关闭了实时共享
And he's turned off his A-TAK's.

1980
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:52,450
抱歉 我插一下嘴
I'm sorry to interrupt,

1981
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:54,990
我听明白你们想说什么了
But I think I'm pickin' up what you gents are layin' down here.

1982
01:39:55,010 --> 01:39:56,840
这些事儿确实不寻常
This is a curious chain of events.

1983
01:39:57,930 --> 01:40:00,770
勒喉乔在找自己的杂种私生子
So Lockjaw's lookin' for his half-breed,

1984
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:03,340
但护崽的妈妈在哪里？
but do we know where the mama bear is?

1985
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,910
这事情可有意思了
Funny you should ask that.

1986
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:09,730
母亲叛娅·富山
Perfidia Beverly Hills.

1987
01:40:10,190 --> 01:40:13,420
目前下落不明 前法式七五成员
Currently M.I.A. Former French 75.

1988
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,760
15年前做了污点证人
She went into witness protection about 15 years ago,

1989
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:18,830
后来就消失了
only to disappear.

1990
01:40:18,950 --> 01:40:20,580
逮捕她的警官
The arresting agent...

1991
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:23,300
正是史蒂文·勒喉乔上校
Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw.

1992
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:26,960
有些报告说她在古巴
Agency sightings have her in Cuba or Algiers,

1993
01:40:26,990 --> 01:40:28,730
也有人说她在阿尔及尔
depending on the report.

1994
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:33,570
看来 她没有母爱
So...not the mothering type, I take it.

1995
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:38,010
他们还好意思说我们野蛮
And they call us the savages.

1996
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:41,790
勒喉乔把自己染脏了
Lockjaw got his dick dirty.

1997
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:46,190
他正在清洗自己
He needs to clean it.

1998
01:40:47,650 --> 01:40:50,130
如果他能找到孩子
If he can find this kid,

1999
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:53,430
他就能消灭证据
He can dispose of the evidence,

2000
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,550
继续把我们耍得团团转
And continue to make fools out of all of us.

2001
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:03,880
您希望我做什么？
What would you like me to do, sir?

2002
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:10,110
提姆 你很擅长解决家庭案件
Tim, given your expertise in family cases,

2003
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:10,630
我们希望你...
we felt that maybe--

2004
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:12,640
处理干净
Make it clean.

2005
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:16,800
干净？
Clean?

2006
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:21,700
要干净到地板都能当镜子
We should all be able to eat off the floor.

2007
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:25,120
对 要不留痕迹
Yeah. It's that clean.

2008
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,280
遵命
Yes, sir.

2009
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:33,460
好了 先生们 我该去西部了
Well, all right, gents. Looks like I'm headed west.

2010
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:36,180
愿圣尼古拉保佑你
And may Saint Nick be with you.

2011
01:41:37,110 --> 01:41:39,670
向圣尼古拉敬礼
All hail Saint Nick.

2012
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:11,710
我能问你一件事吗？
I have something to ask you, okay?

2013
01:42:13,110 --> 01:42:14,430
问吧
'Kay.

2014
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:17,870
她是叛徒吗？
Was she a rat?

2015
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:24,780
对 她是
Yeah, she was.

2016
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:30,200
我爸爸说她是个英雄
My dad told me she was a hero.

2017
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:34,140
不要撞脑袋 不要撞脑袋
Hey, stop banging your head. Stop banging your head.

2018
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:36,650
不要再撞脑袋了
Stop banging your head on that.

2019
01:42:36,670 --> 01:42:37,720
好吧
Okay.

You make sure you take your insulin on a daily basis. Right?

2058
01:44:02,630 --> 01:44:06,070
警官 这里检查不了 他得去急救室

穿过卫生间就是走廊
You are gonna go through the bathroom,

2065
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:27,050

01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:35,250
你的衬衫怎么那么紧？
Why is your shirt so tight?

2216
01:53:41,370 --> 01:53:43,690
你不要乱猜 我可不是基佬
I'm not gay, if that's what you're sayin'.

2217
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:45,020
我可没这么说
I didn't say that.

2218
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:46,880
反正我不是同性恋
I'm not a homosexual.

2219
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,140
这是你提的
I did not say that,

2220
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:50,540
但我确实发现你穿了增高鞋垫
But I see the lifts in your shoes.

2221
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:52,890
你以为自己很聪明吗？
Oh, you are a smartass.

2222
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:54,670
真是太典型了
You... Oh, yeah, yeah.

2223
01:53:54,690 --> 01:53:57,980
你就是个娇生惯养的小公主
You just, you're just a little princess, aren't you?

2224
01:53:58,350 --> 01:54:00,870
就会耍嘴皮子
Smart mouth. Like your mother.

2225
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:04,220
你妈嘴巴也很毒 最后还是被我征服了
Your mother had a smart mouth, and I buried her.

2226
01:54:11,870 --> 01:54:15,210
真聪明 又要看说明书 刚说过就忘了吗？
Are you having trouble remembering what you just read?

2227
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:16,810
如果连成横线 我就有麻烦了
If it's a straight line, I have a problem.

2228
01:54:16,830 --> 01:54:18,480
如果不是 就放我走
If it's not, you have to let me go.

2229
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:19,600
你不可能是我爸爸
God, there's no way I'm actually yours,

2230
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:21,160
因为我没这么笨
'cause I can actually fucking read.

2231
01:54:21,190 --> 01:54:23,400
够了 闭上你的臭嘴
You shut up. Just shut up!

2232
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:26,350
你就是个小杂种
You fucking mutt!

2233
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:46,170
坏了
Uh-oh.

2234
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:09,310
把我车开来 箱子放上面
Get my vehicle. Put my kid in the car.

2235
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:18,520
我从没想过这混蛋还会回来抓我们
Just never thought this fucker would come back for us, you know?

2236
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:23,700
是我大意了 没有好好防范
I got lazy, man. I wasn't payin' attention.

2237
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:30,450
我没想过这混蛋会回来
I thought the person comin' through that door one day

2238
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:33,330
倒是想过她妈叛娅可能会回来
was gonna be her mom, not this fuckin' asshole.

2239
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:40,350
我以为她会回来看女儿 教她一些女孩的事儿
See her daughter, you know, she'd teach her girl stuff,

2240
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:42,840
给她扎个头发
She'd do her hair, she'd...

2241
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:46,320
做回妈妈
Be a mom.

2242
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:53,960
我不懂怎么帮她扎头发
I can't do her hair, man.

2243
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:55,560
你知道吗？
You know that?

2244
01:55:57,540 --> 01:55:59,420
我怎么也扎不好
I don't know how to do her hair right.

2245
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:00,270
是吗？
Well...

2246

Don't go dark on me, Bob.

2247
01:56:12,260 --> 01:56:13,680

Not for you.

还发现了那种事的痕迹
and there was some residue of an interaction.

2500
02:25:12,400 --> 02:25:13,780
那种事？
Interaction?

2501
02:25:14,420 --> 02:25:16,870
她偷了我的生命之源
I believe she was a sperm thief.

2502
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:20,250
偷精生子

2503
02:25:20,270 --> 02:25:21,380
没错
That's correct.

2504
02:25:21,410 --> 02:25:22,740
勒喉乔上校
Colonel Lockjaw,

2505
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:27,130
敌军为什么要大费周章逆向强奸 怀你的孩子？
What would be the purpose of the enemy raping you in reverse?

2506
02:25:29,270 --> 02:25:32,490
我的心智与体魄充满了威能
They saw the power of my mind and body.

2507
02:25:32,890 --> 02:25:34,860

2508
02:25:44,930 --> 02:25:46,940
祝贺你 史蒂文

我带你参观一下西南总部
Let me show you around southwest headquarters.

2512
02:25:56,770 --> 02:25:57,310
好啊

2513
02:25:57,340 --> 02:25:58,170
我们走吧
Should we go for a walk?

2514
02:25:58,190 --> 02:25:59,220
好的
Yes, sir.

2515
02:25:59,240 --> 02:26:00,780

2517
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:03,380
天啊
Oh, my.

2518
02:26:05,220 --> 02:26:07,540
说实话 桑迪先生
You know, if I'm being honest, Sandy,

2519
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:10,170
有那么一刻 我还以为自己失败了
there was a minute there where I didn't think I was gonna make it.

2520
02:26:10,190 --> 02:26:12,540
勒喉乔 有你加入是我们的幸事
Lockjaw, we're lucky to have you.

2521
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:14,700
好了 如你所见 大家都不在
Now, obviously, goes without saying,

2522
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:17,610
这个办公室只是给你挂挂帽子
this is just one place where you can hang your hat,

2523
02:26:17,630 --> 02:26:20,500
开开会 放放个人物品的地方

2526
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:26,530
这个理念太棒了
That's a fine idea.

2527
02:26:26,550 --> 02:26:28,120
办公室现在还空着
Now, it's empty right now,

2528
02:26:28,140 --> 02:26:30,000
但你可以自己布置
But we'll let you personalize it.

2529
02:26:30,020 --> 02:26:32,040
一个人的品味是最重要的
A man's taste defines him, doesn't it?

2530
02:26:32,060 --> 02:26:33,460
您说得太对了
It does indeed, sir.

2531
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:35,630

And here we are.

Would you look at that?

2535
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:47,510
我能进吗？
May I?

2536
02:26:47,540 --> 02:26:48,580
当然可以
Absolutely.

2537
02:26:56,610 --> 02:26:58,990
糟糕 忘了拿你的钥匙
Damn it. I forgot your keys.

2538

Wait here, I'll just grab 'em from my office.

2539
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:01,950

02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:14,970

I've been holding on to something for a while now

2541
02:28:14,990 --> 02:28:17,660
现在我想把它给你

2542
02:28:18,030 --> 02:28:19,190
好吗？
Okay?

2543

之前没有给你是因为...
And I didn't give it to you before because I...

2544
02:28:24,450 --> 02:28:28,220
我不想让你过早地接触这些事情
I just didn't wanna expose you to certain stuff.

2545
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:30,300
说实话我不想让你...
You know, I didn't want you to feel...

2546
02:28:31,150 --> 02:28:32,120
伤心
sad...

2547
02:28:32,140 --> 02:28:33,970
或者为这些事烦恼
or confused about it.

2548
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:37,250
我不知道我想要什么
I don't know. I don't know what I wanted.

2549
02:28:37,270 --> 02:28:38,560

不要受你妈妈的影响
From all your mom's shit.

2552
02:28:45,450 --> 02:28:47,420
也别受我影响
From all my shit.

2553
02:28:48,630 --> 02:28:52,800
我大概只是想 当个好爸爸
I just, I suppose I wanted to be the one

2554
02:28:52,820 --> 02:28:55,360
这样 你有困难的时候会来找我帮忙
that you came to for help, right?

2555
02:28:55,380 --> 02:28:59,250
当一个很酷的爸爸
You know, the one, the cool dad

2556
02:28:59,270 --> 02:29:02,050
能让你敞开心扉
