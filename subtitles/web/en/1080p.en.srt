1
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,300
Welcome.

2
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,350
Our best guess, there's about 250, 275 people in there.

3
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,720
It's hard to count.

4
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,140
We need to be prepared for, like, 300 people

5
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,100
by the time we get there, right?

6
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,980
Our cargo container,

7
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,110
18-wheeler, that thing only holds 160 people.

8
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,650
I'm talking 'bout crammed in there tight...

9
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,240
That's cheek to jowl.

10
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,780
...smashed face to face.

11
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,620
Women and children first.

12
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,990
Listen, whoever's not on with us,

13
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,580
- they just run, on foot. - Just go.

14
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,830
That's it. If they're not with us, they run.

15
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,000
Via de la Amistad, that's our exit route.

16
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,290
Runs east-west. It's about one mile from 905.

17
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,500
- Right. - What you draggin' in that wagon?

18
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,840
Listen, I got HMEs.

19
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,220
I got mortars, I got tear gas, I got whatever you guys need,

20
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,180
but I'm a little unclear as to what the plan is.

21
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,430
- I'm gonna need some direction. - Don't be unclear.

22
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,100
- I got a plan for us. - Well, what is it?

23
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,430
I mean, you want me to create a diversion?

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,600
You want me to blow something up?

25
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,690
What do you want?

26
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,150
I want you to create a show, Pat.

27
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,190
Okay? This is the announcement of the motherfuckin' revolution.

28
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,700
- Yeah. - Make it good. Make it bright.

29
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,870
Impress me.

30
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,950
Team Two's entrance. We got that?

31
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,240
Yep. That runs north and south.

32
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,410
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

33
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,000
- Give Pat a walkie. - Gimme a walkie.

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,580
Big truck coming up Enrico Fermi...

35
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,870
- Channel five. - Copy that.

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,790
Yeah! It's game time. No more talking 'bout this.

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,960
- Let's go! - All right, let's go,

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,210
- let's go, let's go. - Let's fuckin' go.

39
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,350
Watch, watch, watch.

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Get on your knees, like you 'bout to suck a dick.

41
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,620
Gate guard secure.

42
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,510
Hey, you. Get up. Hands up. Get up.

43
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,390
- Down. Hey you, get up. - Get your hands up.

44
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,230
- Wake up. All the way up! - Down on the ground.

45
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,310
Hands up. Don't look at me.

46
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,480
- All the way up. - Wake up.

47
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,020
Wake up, soldier boy.

48
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,570
You died and went to pussy heaven, motherfucker.

49
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,030
Put your arms to the side so I can see you.

50
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,330
What's your name, dickhead?

51
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,960
I'm Captain Steven J. Lockjaw.

52
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,750
My name is Perfidia Beverly Hills,

53
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,460
and this is a declaration of war.

54
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,680
We're here to right your wrongs, motherfucker.

55
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,390
You got an army growin' in your fuckin' guts,

56
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,890
and you put it there.

57
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,970
You didn't count on me.

58
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,060
- Oh, my God. - You didn't count on my fight.

59
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,560
The message is clear.

60
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,480
Free borders, free bodies, free choices,

61
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,060
and free from fuckin' fear!

62
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,730
Sweet thing.

63
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,610
Is this funny?

64
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,820
Mm.

65
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,240
Get up.

66
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,540
Not on your feet.

67
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,830
Oh, not on your fuckin' feet.

68
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,210
Since we playin'...

69
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,510
get it up.

70
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,180
Up.

71
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,890
Yeah.

72
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,520
Get it up.

73
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,810
Guys, hurry up!

74
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,230
Be careful! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

75
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,780
Apurarse. Hurry, hurry, hurry! But be careful!

76
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,860
Be careful! All the way to the back.

77
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,820
Holy shit.

78
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,750
Keep it moving now.

79
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,580
Up.

80
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,170
Good boy.

81
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,000
- - Mm.

82
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,510
You like lockin' people up, huh?

83
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,680
- Mm. - Oh, yeah.

84
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,800
- - Get on your fuckin' knees!

85
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,430
Now.

86
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,970
Let's go, let's go.

87
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,980
Put it on.

88
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,770
- Let's go!-

89
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,570
Now get the fuck up.

90
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,870
Let's go. Hands up. Keep that dick up.

91
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,200
- - Keep it up.

92
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,330
The fuck out.

93
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,340
Pat.

94
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,420
Go for Pat.

95
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,680
Snap, crackle, pop, baby.

96
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,800
Copy that.

97
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,600
Come on, come on!

98
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,860
I declare war, motherfucker.

99
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,170
I'll be seeing you very soon.

100
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,710
Not if I see you first, fuck face.

101
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,010
We are a political organization

102
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,430
that is free from the eyes,

103
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,520
the ears, and most importantly,

104
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,270
the weapons of the imperialist state,

105
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,190
and this fascist regime!

106
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,230
You are a political prisoner of the French 75, motherfuckers!

107
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,320
You've been captured by the French 75!

108
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,780
Fuck the police!

109
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,120
- ¡Viva la revolución! - Let's go!

110
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,000
Motherfuckers, órale!

111
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,340
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

112
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,550
- Hold on, y'all, hold on. - Shit. Oh, shit.

113
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,050
Where you get all this energy from?

114
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,510
- What are you talkin' about?-

115
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,130
I'm getting Ghetto Pat tonight. I think I like you.

116
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,680
- You like Black girls? - Mm-hmm.

117
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,850
- Yeah? - Do I like what?

118
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,640
- You like...-

119
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,390
Y'all think he like Black girls? Y'all think he like me?

120
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,230
- I think he does. - 'Course I fuckin' like Black girls!

121
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,730
So shoot this shit up! Let's go!

122
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,350
What the fuck do you think I'm doing here?

123
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,060
- Let's go! - Fuck your mother!

124
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,690
You know I like fuckin' Black girls!

125
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,900
You know I like Black girls.

126
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,650
And I love you. You love me? Tell me you love me.

127
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,200
- Tell me you fuckin' love me. - I love you.

128
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
--

129
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
Calm down. Calm the fuck down.

130
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,580
What I'm doing here

131
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,380
is I'm creating a closed circuit

132
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,340
to remove any static electricity.

133
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,680
And that right there...

134
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
That's a shunt. You see that?

135
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,350
Yeah.

136
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,810
This is your blasting cap.

137
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,890
Mm.

138
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,850
Right here.

139
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,530
Very important to keep your cap shunted like this

140
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,490
when you enter the courthouse. You got that?

141
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,280
Here's your main charge.

142
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,410
This is your cell phone.

143
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,750
Don't stop. I see the cell phone.

144
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,210
First thing you're gonna do is you're gonna turn on your cell phone

145
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,920
without your...

146
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,300
without your cap attached...

147
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,590
so you don't accidentally detonate your charge.

148
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,180
You're gonna wanna...

149
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,520
You're gonna wanna put your hands here, right?

150
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,890
- Mmm. - And then you wanna

151
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,810
take your hands and the cap

152
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,270
and throw it in the circle.

153
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,320
Senator Wilson, this is a warning for you.

154
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,320
We planted a bomb at the Haymarket office

155
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,450
of your re-election campaign.

156
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,280
We warned you, that abortion ban, and you didn't wanna fuckin' listen.

157
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,750
So, for my sisters in need, we will strike.

158
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,330
Sincerely yours, Perfidia Beverly Hills, motherfucker.

159
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,210
Revolutionary violence is the only way.

160
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,970
No more tellin' me to vote.

161
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,130
No more tellin' me to overcome.

162
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,390
"Nobody move, nobody get hurt" shit, it doesn't matter.

163
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,640
Everybody pays.

164
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,680
Don't even bother lookin' for the French 75.

165
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,190
We'll find you.

166
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,160
- Okay, baby, you ready? - Yeah.

167
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,380
All right. All right, all right. Let's go.

168
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,380
- Babe... - Yeah?

169
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,460
Let's fuck while the bomb go off.

170
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,880
- No, babe. - Come on, baby.

171
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,380
- Let's fuck, baby. - Come on, baby, we gotta go.

172
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,800
- Hurry. - Come on. Come on, baby.

173
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,850
- Let's fuck, baby. - No, baby. We gotta go.

174
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,680
- Come on, come on. Baby. - Come on. Come on.

175
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,560
- Come on, baby. - We gotta go. Come on, baby.

176
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,350
- Come on, baby. Hold on. Wait. - Bomb goes off in two minutes.

177
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,870
Bring 'em all!

178
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,130
- Come on!-

179
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,390
Don't say a fuckin' word, okay? You understand me?

180
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,680
- Get the rest! - Oh, yeah.

181
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,890
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

182
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,810
- Come on, come on!-

183
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,950
Stay right there. Don't you fuckin' move.

184
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,030
Grab him! Let's go.

185
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,950
Stay right fucking there, okay?

186
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,740
You fucking move, I'll blow your fucking head off.

187
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,840
Regular-working White girl.

188
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,890
Now do your thing.

189
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,280
We have two devices for two locations,

190
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,320
set three blocks apart.

191
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,450
Mae West completes her device in the administration building,

192
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,620
Perfidia and I take the courthouse.

193
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,330
Bombs are planted,

194
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,250
devices are detonated by remote at 7 p.m. after hours.

195
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,050
From here on in, it's one battle after another.

196
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,780
What do you want me to do?

197
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,610
I want you to do your worst.

198
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,080
You can blow up anything you want,

199
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,040
it doesn't make any difference to me.

200
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,660
I want my hat.

201
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,000
And my gun.

202
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,590
If you wanna keep doing what you're doing,

203
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,720
you'll meet me at the Primrose Path, 2300.

What the fuck? That...

240
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,350
It's like she doesn't even realize she's pregnant.

241
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,680
Some other white chocolate daddy over there

242
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,890
and all this shit.

243
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,770
- You right. - You feel me? No...

244
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,190
Okay, so put one up and down.

245
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,360
- Okay. - Okay, so that means...

246
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,650
- I'm the house. - Okay, yeah.

247
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,080
You know, you are so unsuitable for my daughter.

248
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,950
Me?

249
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,120
Yeah, you.

250
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,660
And that's hilarious.

251
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,380
I don't...

252
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,510
My child comes from a whole line of revolutionaries.

253
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,300
And you look so lost.

254
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,140
She's a runner, and you a stump.

255
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,930
What are you gonna do about this baby? Hm?

256
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,280
No, I just, I wanna feel seen and loved and...

257
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,530
I fuckin' carried her nine months.

258
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,950
And now he can just, gets to fuckin' walk around...

259
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,210
and just swoonin' all fuckin' day.

260
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,670
It's like she's his only girl.

261
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,250
Like, I just no longer exist. I'm just a fuckin' piece of meat.

262
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,920
And sometimes, I feel crazy, 'cause I'm just like...

263
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,390
am I weird for being jealous of my baby?

264
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,100
I don't fuckin' feel seen. I don't feel love.

265
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,600
I feel fuckin' ugly. My nipples hurt.

266
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,940
I can barely fucking produce milk.

267
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,070
I'm not okay.

268
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,410
Baby, where do you think you're goin', huh?

269
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,710
- Where you goin' like that? - Stop talkin' to me.

270
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,250
I go as I please.

271
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,340
You realize that we're a family now, right?

272
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,170
You don't have to do this anymore.

273
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,220
You realize I put myself first, right? And that's what you scared of.

274
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,100
We have her now.

275
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,930
You do get that, right?

276
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,140
I put myself first, and I reject your lack of originality.

277
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,110
God, my lack of originality. Will you stop with all this bullshit?

278
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,400
Would you stop it? We're a goddamn family.

279
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,820
You have her to take care of.

280
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,820
Where the hell do you think you're goin'?

281
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,580
- - It's okay, baby.

282
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,460
It's okay, baby. It's okay. It's okay, baby.

283
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,880
It's okay.

284
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,220
This is a new consciousness.

285
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,350
- New consciousness? - Yeah.

286
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,010
I'm not your udder buddy.

287
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,100
I'm not your mother.

288
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,270
You want your power over me,

289
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,560
the same reason you want your power over the world.

290
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,990
You and your crumblin' male ego

291
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,400
will never do this revolution like me.

292
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,070
Fuck outta here.

293
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,830
Do the revolution, baby. Go do it.

294
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,680
You got a baby?

295
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,310
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

296
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,900
Male? Female?

297
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,980
She's a girl.

298
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,780
What's her name?

299
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,780
Charlene.

300
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,490
Charlene.

301
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,660
Sounds like a Black girl's name.

302
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,290
You like Black girls?

303
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,620
I love 'em.

304
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,000
I love them!

305
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,520
- Get on your knees. - Get on your fuckin' knees.

306
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,110
- Don't move. - Now!

307
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,030
Good job.

308
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,900
Get your noses in the carpet.

309
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,990
My name is Junglepussy.

310
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,450
This is what power looks like.

311
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,780
- Put it in. - See my face?

312
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,040
Put it there.

313
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,410
- This some Set It Off shit. - Hands up. Put your hands up.

314
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,460
- I don't want you. - Put your hands up.

315
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,370
I just want your money.

316
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,420
Your money pays for my artillery, my supplies,

317
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,550
my transportation, my dynamite, my message.

318
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,470
I am what Black Power looks like.

319
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,430
See my face?

320
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,020
See my face!

321
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,270
- I'm the French 75!-

322
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,020
Stop moving.

323
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,200
Stop fucking moving.

324
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,700
Stop fuckin' moving, man.

325
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,930
All right, go.

326
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,040
- - Cuff the left arm, please.

327
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,770
This department doesn't do any special favors,

328
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,560
especially for Black girls.

329
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,570
You're a killer, and that's the least of it.

330
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,990
You'll do 30, 40 years in prison.

331
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,620
It's too bad you don't know anybody with sway.

332
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,210
You can save me.

333
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,400
Because you're in love with me.

334
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,860
Yes.

335
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,240
And you can't live without me.

336
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,410
Can you hold me?

337
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,660
I can give you the embrace

338
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,380
of the federal government.

339
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,760
You've gotta tell me where they are, and name names.

340
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,590
Don't do this.

341
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,470
You have to name names, or you're gonna go to prison.

342
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,020
- - Miss Minnie,

343
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,810
do you have a car seat or a carrier?

344
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,100
No, no, no, baby.

345
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,440
These are two scanners that I've made.

346
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,110
This one plays Melody A.

347
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,940
- This one plays Melody B. - Uh-huh.

348
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,820
Together, they go off within 200 or 300 yards of each other,

349
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,910
they sync up, they'll play a main melody.

350
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,580
- Main melody. - Okay? Somebody else has one of these,

351
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,700
you both know the tune, you'll be able to find each other.

352
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,700
- This is a trust device. - Right.

353
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,580
Okay? Rule of thumb with these scanners,

354
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,880
find somebody else out there and they happen to have one of these,

355
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,500
trust them with your life, okay?

356
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,380
I'm not passing these out to just anybody.

357
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,960
- She might be hungry. - I need some towels.

358
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,720
Miss Minnie, can you get me some towels?

359
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,840
Yeah. All right.

360
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,180
Okay. What's wrong?

361
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,930
I know. We're going.

362
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,760
- Get a phone or don't... - If you gotta get a cell, make it 1G.

363
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,850
The early analogue stuff,

364
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,480
they don't scan those frequencies anymore.

365
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,140
You'll be fine. Otherwise, no phones.

366
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,230
- Okay. - If the towers are up,

367
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,310
we're gonna be able to find each other in any case.

368
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,520
- All right. - Memorize everything in this envelope.

369
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,860
Burn it when you're done.

370
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,150
You don't go to Baktan Cross right away.

371
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,910
You go to Denver first. You spend a week in Denver.

372
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,160
While you're in Denver, plant those decoys.

373
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,410
When that's all clear and that job is done,

374
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,250
then you go on to Baktan Cross.

375
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,160
These are the new names and socials.

376
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,170
Right, so who are we supposed to be here?

377
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,920
You are Bob and Willa Ferguson.

378
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,630
It's a mother and son who died in childbirth last month.

379
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,960
So we're pretending to be dead folks?

380
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,550
If you wanna think about it that way, yes,

381
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,010
but there are bigger deaths down the line if we don't do this.

382
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,800
I want you to think big picture here, all right?

383
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,310
- Right. Right. - This is bigger than you or I.

384
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,270
This is bigger than the original Bob and Willa Ferguson, okay?

385
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,640
Guys, you better hurry up.

386
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,810
Yeah.

387
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,440
Welcome to the world, Bob.

388
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,110
Let's go! Big picture.

389
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,610
Got it. Yeah.

390
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,530
Okay.

391
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,650
Okay. Okay.

392
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,070
You're safe.

393
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,410
- I gotta go. I'm sorry, okay? - Okay.

394
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,120
- I know you do, but... - I'm sorry.

395
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,210
I know, but you not sure you wanna let her stay with us?

396
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,710
- I gotta go, I gotta go! - I know, I know.

397
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,960
But travel in grace. Oh, my God.

398
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,590
Here. Hold her.

399
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,710
- All right, I got her, I got her. - Thanks.

400
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,720
- Come on, baby girl, come on. - Watch her head.

401
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,850
All right.

402
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,640
- Love you. - I love you.

403
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,400
- Take care. - Stay safe.

404
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,530
Okay.

405
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,870
Home sweet home.

406
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,040
We've been through all this before,

407
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,750
but I've gotta go through it one more time.

408
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,250
No contact ever with anyone from Josie and the Pussycats

409
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,380
or any of your former associates.

410
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,840
No family. No friends.

411
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,960
Don't commit any crimes.

412
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,510
You will testify when we need you to testify.

413
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,100
Look, first order of business, find a job.

414
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,600
Pay your bills.

415
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,310
- You good? - Mm-hmm.

416
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,020
Welcome to mainstream America.

417
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,730
Every revolution begins fightin' demons

418
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,440
but motherfuckers just end up fightin' themselves.

419
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,700
Hands up! Put your hands up over your head!

420
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,700
She's in the back!

421
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,660
Get your hands up! Higher!

422
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,810
For valor in the line of duty

423
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,350
and bringing justice to the vigilante group

424
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,770
known as the French 75,

425
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,030
we are here to award Steven J. Lockjaw

426
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,740
with the Bedford-Forrest Medal of Honor.

427
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,340
Sixteen years later,

428
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,340
the world had changed very little.

429
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,070
You're not breathing.

430
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,990

Teachin' the right kind of history, I hope.

449
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,120
Lincoln.

450
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Mm-hmm.

451
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,500
I see you got all the greats here, huh?

452
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,710
Oh, yeah.

453
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,420
What were his intentions?

454
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,750
Got Teddy Roosevelt over there. You got...

455
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,760
Hope you teach about the Philippines and all that.

456
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,760
We don't get all into the details just yet,

457
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,180
- but we don't hide from them, either. - You should.

458
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,010
You should. Gotta tell the truth.

459
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,640
And then you got the Grand Wizard over there, right?

460
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,640
- Mr. Benjamin Franklin. - Mm.

461
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,310
Forefather.

462
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,060
- Hm? - Mm.

463
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,230
Fuckin' slave owner.

464
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,110
You... I'm afraid you can't do that here in the classroom.

465
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,660
- Fuckin' slave owners everywhere. - Thanks.

466
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,530
Um...

467
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,450
Well, overall, to get into it,

468
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,420
Willa's doing really great.

469
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
Mm.

470
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,880
She's a confident leader.

471
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,050
- Mm-hmm. - She works hard.

472
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:22,340
You can tell that she actually cares about being a good student, you know?

473
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,220
She enters class each day ready to work, full of energy.

474
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,560
The other students really admire her, um...

475
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,020
Are you okay?

476
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,980
If I get emotional, it's just um...

477
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,280
- tears of joy, that's all. - Oh.

478
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,030
I see this is very emotional for you.

479
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,740
I don't know...

480
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,370
You know, Willa grew up without her mom.

481
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,290
Her mom died when she was very young.

482
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,130
Oh. I see.

483
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,300
Hm.

484
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,630
So Willa never knew her mother?

485
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,840
No. She never did.

486
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,680
That can be very hard on a young woman.

487
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,960
Sir, I have Lieutenant Skinner here to speak with you.

488
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,470
What do you got, Skinner?

489
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:51,350
Sir, Deputy Director of Progress has orders to speak to you, sir.

490
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,520
Your transportation is set for 1800 hours, sir.

491
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,560
You know what this is about, Skinner?

492
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,480
- No, sir, I'm... - Well, I think I do.

493
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,530
That'll be all, Lieutenant.

494
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,630
Welcome, Colonel. Please follow me.

495
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,380
Have somebody tell my wife I'll be down in a few minutes.

496
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,220
Colonel Lockjaw, thanks for coming.

497
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,510
Sandy, great to see you.

498
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,220
Let me introduce you to Virgil Throckmorton.

499
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,390
- Virgil, Colonel Steve Lockjaw. - Steve Lockjaw.

500
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,100
- How do you do, Colonel? - My pleasure, sir.

501
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,730
Yeah, I'm sorry about all the espionage at the back entrance.

502
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,900
My daughter's getting married and dress was formal.

503
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,400
So, we didn't want you to feel out of place.

504
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,650
Perfectly understandable, sir.

505
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,730
Please, sit.

506
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,280
Shane Mitchell sends a hello.

507
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,820
The big dog. He still building out that garage?

508
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,780
The construction project that never ends.

509
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,950
I'm sure he'll get it done. Will you give him my best?

510
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,120
- Will do. - Thank you.

511
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,620
How was your journey from Rio Duarte?

512
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,710
Fine, sir.

513
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,830
You're doing great work down there.

514
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,000
Thank you very much, sir.

515
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,920
Each and every day is hand-to-hand combat

516
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
in the spread of uncontrolled migration, isn't it?

517
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,340
- Yes, it is, sir. - Yeah.

518
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,970
Well, "You wanna save the planet, you start with immigration."

519
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,470
That's exactly right, sir.

520
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,720
You said that.

521
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,930
A few years back, after Squatting Pebble.

522
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,100
- Ah.-

523
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,940
I understand you've expressed an interest in us.

524
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,480
Yes, sir, I have.

525
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,990
And does it honor you to be considered for membership in our club?

526
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:14,530
It's a very deep honor, sir. Yes, it is.

527
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,370
Steve, we have, in the past,

528
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,830
offered membership to certain members of the military.

529
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,340
We found their tactical battlefield expertise

530
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,550
to be quite useful.

531
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,720
Now, our aim and your aim is the same.

532
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,340
To find dangerous lunatics,

533
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:36,810
haters, and punk trash and stop them.

534
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,310
No more lunatics.

535
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,350
Mm.

536
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,480
Now, I'm not sure if you've heard or not,

537
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,770
but Jim Kringle passed away.

538
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,110
Oh, I did hear that, yes.

539
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,070
This means an opening.

540
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,360
- Mm. - Colonel,

541
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:56,450
I don't think I'm being immodest when I say

542
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,040
that joining the Christmas Adventurers Club

543
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,290
means that you are a superior man.

544
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,290
No, not the best man, not the most intelligent,

545
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,090
the most sophisticated, or the wisest.

546
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:12,510
It just means that you are superior to other human beings,

547
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,300
and you shall never want for riches

548
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,100
or the greatest of friends.

549
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:22,140
Now, we report to ourselves with a freedom to be creative

550
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,850
and cut through layers of bureaucracy.

551
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,810
We live by the Golden Rule,

552
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,900
in a network of like-minded men and women

553
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,440
dedicated to makin' the world safe and pure.

554
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,570
What would you say to someone who believes

555
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,450
that you have been soft in your duty to racial purification?

556
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:46,710
I would say they are a liar who has no business in society.

557
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,540
Or on the planet, for that matter. Mm.

558
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,630
- Do you presently live with a spouse? - No, sir.

559
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,550
Have you ever consulted with a mental health professional?

560
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
No, sir.

561
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,930
Have you ever had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency?

562
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,770
Mm. Well, I did purchase a jet ski.

563
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:07,980
It was an evolution of the old Hummingbird Whisperdoo 238.

564
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,360
Called the Dynamite Dolphin 335.

565
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,520
It was defective.

566
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,780
I abstained from payment. I'd do it again. I have no regrets.

567
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,860
Okay.

568
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,450
Have you ever knowingly engaged

569
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,790
in any acts of terrorism against this country?

570
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,290
No, sir.

571
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,750
Have you ever engaged in an interracial relationship?

572
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,420
No, sir.

573
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,760
And you are American-born by gentile?

574
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,840
Yes, sir.

575
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,630
Mm-hmm.

576
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,260
Now, to avoid any misunderstanding,

577
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:45,140
we require absolute secrecy through the initiation process

578
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,810
to judge how serious and unselfish you are.

579
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,400
- You understand? - Mm-hmm.

580
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,190
And to be considered to a vote,

581
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,900
you must submit to a voluntary vulnerability study.

582
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,660
This identifies anything problematic in your character.

583
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,700
What could be a problem?

584
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,160
I don't know. What could be a problem?

585
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,210
Absolutely nothing.

586
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,000
We wanna know who we're standing with.

587
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,330
Sure.

588
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,960
Now, it's a Double Yankee White Inquisitions Completum.

589
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,470
So if you have any doubt as to your ability

590
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,880
to qualify in body or character

591
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,260
as a member of the Christmas Adventurers Club,

592
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,180
now you have an opportunity to say so.

593
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,690
- Do you wish to withdraw? - No, sir.

594
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,860
Do you submit yourself?

595
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,730
Yes, sir. I submit myself.

596
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,940
Very well, then.

597
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,780
Now Sandy and I have to get down to cut the cake.

598
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:42,870
Oh.

599
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,120
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding.

600
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,460
Thank you. We'll be in touch.

601
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,870
Thank you.

602
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,170
- Steve. - Thank you, sir. Thank you, Sandy.

603
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,760
Maybe starting to see how corrupt to the core

604
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,220
this whole fucking charade is.

605
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,140
This great, noble experiment in self-government.

606
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:52,270
Bought and sold by billionaires. The Davos crowd.

607
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:55,650
Openly racist, fucking Bell Curve Nazis.

608
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:59,440
It's bedtime for democracy, comrades. Good night.

609
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,570
So you're feeling like maybe your mind is starting to erode? Good.

610
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,660
B-Q-W-5-L-P-A, go ahead.

611
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,580
This is happening on the ground through coordinated effort,

612
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,500
and strategic lines of resistance...

613
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,920
every day, working through dedicated teamwork

614
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,130
to take it directly to the capitalist overlords,

615
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,220
who are extracting value from your life

616
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,590
this very second.

617
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,100
Go ahead.

618
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,100
What, you think this is Facebook?

619
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,020
This is gonna happen on your Instagram?

620
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,810
It's gonna happen on a hashtag somewhere?

621
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,190
I think not.

622
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,770
And don't forget, while you're doing it,

623
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,780
that this is a nation that gives asylum.

624
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,320
Don't think they're separate.

625
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,650
Don't break them apart. They're not...

626
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,160
What the fuck?

627
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,040
"QST, QST, QST!

628
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,950
Attention, all sanctuary stations.

629
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,580
Billy Goat is in the wind.

630
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,080

00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,340

Repeat, implement plan Snap, Crackle, Pop."

00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:49,340
QST, QST, QST!

635
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,510
Attention, all sanctuary stations.

636
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,100
Billy Goat is in the wind.

637
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,180
{\an8}Repeat, Billy Goat is in the wind.

638
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,730
Implement plan Snap, Crackle, Pop.

639
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:59,600
Repeat, plan Snap, Crackle, Pop.

640
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,860
What's up, my man? You got my guy?

641
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,610
Any SSE in the car?

642
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:06,900
- No. - No?

643
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,200
Come here, dirtbag.

644
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,830
Howard Sommerville.

645
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,540
- How are you? - Good.

646
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,670
The French 75.

647
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:24,920
The Resistance.

648
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,300
The Gringo Coyote?

649
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,680
Billy Goat?

650
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,010
- Done your homework. - Mm-hmm.

651
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,310
Good. Take a look around. Take it all in.

652
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:37,770
Do you need anything?

653
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,310
- I'm fine. - A drink?

654
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,650
I'm okay.

655
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,110
You're still alive. That's a good sign, right?

656
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:44,320
Seem to be.

657
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,860
Yeah. Do you know why you're still alive?

658
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,070
- You tell me. - I will tell you.

659
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,990
I need you to tell me where Baby Charlene is,

660
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,030
what's her name, where does she live?

661
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,490
I need to know where The Rocket Man lives.

662
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,790
I need to know his name.

663
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,120
- Okay. - Ghetto Pat.

664
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,130
Okay. I can cooperate.

665
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:06,500
Their names are Fred Flintstone and Arthur Fonzarelli

666
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:08,720
and their address is Alpha Centauri.

667
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,050
I love it. I love it.

668
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,970
Motherfucker's sittin' on plastic in a container, he's still got jokes.

669
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,060
I just want you to know that I'm not scared.

670
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,890
I appreciate that.

671
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,190
If I was in your shoes, I wouldn't be scared, either.

672
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:25,900
I just don't know if your sister would feel that way.

673
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,360
What's his sister's name?

674
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,440
Pamela.

675
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,830
Oh, no more jokes?

676
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,210
What are their names and where do they live?

677
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,380
Their names are Bob and Willa Ferguson.

678
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,880
They're up in Baktan Cross.

679
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,930
Baktan Cross.

680
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:00,480
Make me a reason to deploy in that town.

681
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,100
- Drugs and tacos. - Got it.

682
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,690
And get all the intel on the gathering spots,

683
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,560
the hotspots for teenyboppers.

684
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:07,860
On it.

685
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,030
Shep.

686
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,830
Shep. Hey, come here, come here.

687
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:22,750
- - Where'd you...

688
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:25,670
Come, come with me. How ya doin'?

689
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,750
--

690
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,710
Get it!

691
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,090
Shep!

692
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,390
Shep.

693
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:41,930
Shep.

694
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,020
Gentlemen, this is Operation Boot Heel.

695
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,850
Our AO is Baktan Cross.

696
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,270
This is a sanctuary city full of thousands of wet 'n stinkies.

697
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,490
We have a TST operation to capture two HVIs.

698
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,150
Adult male, Bob Ferguson.

699
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,280
Female juvenile, Willa Ferguson, age 16, the daughter.

700
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,830
We bag-and-tag the male. We apprehend the female.

701
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,270
Intel update.

702
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,190
Baktan High School dance today, 1800.

703
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,530
Grades nine through 12.

704
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,740
Break, break, break, net call one-three.

705
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,780
We're gonna split the team. Cell One to the high school.

706
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,950
Cell Two to the residence with me.

707
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,600
Good evening, gentlemen. Special Agent Toejam.

708
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,430
Our main target tonight is

709
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,720
Rimhorn's Chicken Lickin' Frozen Food Farm.

710
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:08,230
HUMINT reporting has led us to believe Chicken Lickin' is a front

711
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:11,310
for a large-scale heroin distribution operation within the AO.

712
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:14,190
BTR, your main effort,

713
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,530
you are tasked with the clearing and securing

714
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,860
of Chicken Lickin' Frozen Food Farm in order to destroy

715
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,990
heroin distribution operations within the AO.

716
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,740
Simultaneously, local law enforcement,

717
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,910
you will clear and secure Blatski's Tires,

718
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,830
Raliberto's Mexican Restaurant on Old California Road,

719
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,420
Tiburón's Taco Shack in the Baktan Mall,

720
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,050
and the gas station on J and Boiler Street.

721
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:38,420
This is a sanctuary city for thousands of wet bodies.

722
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:42,220
Expect the local populace to be sympathetic and supportive

723
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,640
to the criminal organizations we are targeting tonight, gentlemen.

724
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,740
Thank you.

725
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,370
You're hungover, and you got home at 3:00 in the morning.

726
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:07,120
- - Where were you?

727
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,830
Where, what? This isn't even warm, sweetie.

728
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:11,330
Where were you?

729
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,500
Where was I? I was...

730
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,420
Well, I specifically told you where I was.

731
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,260
You asked me that. I told you where I was.

732
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:21,010
I was at the Rustic Inn with the old band.

733
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:23,890
You remember our old band, right?

734
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:26,890
The old band, sweetie.

735
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,060
A Block Past Normal. You remember Albert?

736
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:29,980
Yeah.

737
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:33,400
Turns out, Albert bought all this old equipment

738
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,110
from Steely Dan's old studio

739
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,990
to try to get that sort of vintage, you know,

740
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:41,360
that sort of crackling tube sound.

741
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,030
You don't need any of that stuff anymore.

742
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,990
He brought out a computer program.

743
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,120
Boom, with the press of a button--

744
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,160
How'd you get home?

745
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,330
What do you mean?

746
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:52,870
- How did you get home? - Well, with my car.

747
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,000
You drove?

748
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,340
So what are you, my babysitter? What, what, what...

749
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,380
- Yeah. - I know how to drink and drive, honey.

750
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,840
I know what I'm doin'.

751
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,430
- I didn't have that much. - Dad.

752
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:05,550
What? What?

753
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,970
- - What?

754
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,600
I don't wanna be your babysitter.

755
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,970
I don't wanna worry if you wrapped your car

756
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:10,980
around a telephone pole.

757
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,890
- Well, I didn't wrap my-- - I didn't ask for this.

758
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,900
That's just how the cards were rolled out for me.

759
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,520
- It's "dice," sweetie. - What?

760
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:21,030
It's not "cards." You don't roll cards. It's dice.

761
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,490
Fuck off, Bob. Just fuck off with that, okay?

762
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:24,450
Grow up.

763
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,780
Wow. Okay.

764
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,740
Well, you... Look.

765
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:31,290
I like the way you're standin' up for yourself.

766
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,040
I'm proud of ya, honey,

767
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,500
but the way you, uh,

768
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,830
speak to your father sometimes, it's just...

769
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:38,790
I don't know. You're right.

770
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,710
You should tell me what you think, always.

771
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,170
Never hold anything back from me.

772
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,010
What the fuck is wrong with you?

773
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,760
You're right. That's somethin' I gotta remember.

774
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,890
And I fuck up sometimes.

775
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,390
Whoa. Who's this? Who's that?

776
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,610
- Who is that? - They're just my friends.

777
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:02,740
And they just, they have a red car like that, just drivin'...

778
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,990
Little loud, don't you think?

779
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,030
It's just a car.

780
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:06,490
And you told 'em they could do that?

781
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:07,780
- Yes. - Told 'em to come to the house?

782
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:08,700
Yes!

783
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,530
Now, who's the one with the lipstick?

784
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,950
What's that one's name?

785
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,660
- Bobo. - Bobo.

786
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,620
Now, is that a he or a she or a they?

787
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,580
Dad, come on.

788
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,380
No, are they transitioning? I wanna know if...

789
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,460
They're nonbinary.

790
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,000
Okay, I just wanna be polite. All right.

791
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,880
It's not that hard! "They, them."

792
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,590
And who's this little fuckin' freak at the door?

793
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,510
Probably Bluto.

794
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:27,840
They're just comin' to my house like this, huh?

795
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,180
- Yes! - All right.

796
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,850
Is that your date to the dance?

797
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,350
- My friend. - Okay.

798
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:35,180
You're not goin' anywhere with your goddamn friend until you take it.

799
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:36,770
Take it!

800
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:45,190
- Yep. Put it in your pocket. - I don't wanna put it in my pocket.

801
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,070
Put it in your garter or whatever you got.

802
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:47,990
My fucking garter?

803
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:49,450
- - What? Mother...

804
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,200
- What's up, homie? - Hey, how's it goin'?

- I was just here to pick up Willa. - Yeah, yeah.

807
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,210
You normally knock that loud at somebody's house like that?

808
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:57,870
- Uh, yeah. - Yeah, give us a sec, homie.

809
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:00,540
Put it in... You got a purse?

810
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,170
This is non-negotiable! Put it in your purse!

811
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,380
Nobody's coming to get you, Bob. You know that, right?

812
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,630
That's what you think.

813
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,680
What's up, guys? You guys cool?

814
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,300

Goin' to the dance?

Yeah, it's cool.

to your entire fuckin' family.

820
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:22,360
- I'm not fuckin' around. - Wait, what?

821
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,480

We're talkin' about freedom, baby.

823
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,610
We're talkin' about freedom.

824
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,530
Freedom's a funny thing, isn't it?

825
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:31,240
When ya have it, you... you don't appreciate it,

826
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,990
and when you miss it, it's gone.

827
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,490
- It's just gone. Poof! - Okay.

828
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,170
There's a quinoa casserole with Frosted Flakes in the oven.

- You have a gun, right? - Okay? Yes.

1066
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:33,810
- Okay. - Right now, it's a goddamn roundup.

1067
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,980
I gotta deal with this shit.

1068
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,770
Okay. Yeah, let's, let's...

1069
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:40,020
- Let's take that to go. Come on. - Let's go to your place.

1070
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,150
Let's go to your place. I'll charge my phone.

1071
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:43,780
- You got a gun there. - Bob, Bob, Bob.

1072
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,860
- What? What? - Get off the tatami.

1073
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,820
- Okay. Yeah. - Okay. Listen.

1074
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,120
- Breathe. - All right.

1075
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,030
Okay? Cool out.

1076
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:53,410
Ocean waves. Ocean waves.

1077
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,700
- Ocean waves. - Let's go.

1078
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:57,040
Let's go. I'll follow you. Come on.

1079
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:10,600
Got a little Latino Harriet Tubman situation

1080
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,810
going on at my place.

1081
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:13,970
All legit, from the heart. No cash.

1082
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:15,680
Here, use my phone.

1083
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:17,890
No, no. No, no, man, they trace that.

1084
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:19,520
You understand? They trace those calls.

1085
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:22,070
- What's with the shades? - Fuck.

1086
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,360
Look, me and Willa's mom, we used to run around

1087
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,200
and do some real bad shit together, all right?

1088
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,370
We were part of the French 75.

1089
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:32,490
They got her, now they're comin' after us.

1090
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,700
Fuck.

1091
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,460
You're a bad hombre, Bob.

1092
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:45,590
Sit down.

1093
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,430
I'm Agent Danvers. How are you?

1094
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,390
- Great. - Great. What's your name?

1095
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:54,470
Bluto.

1096
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,390
Bluto. Nice to meet you, Bluto.

1097
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:57,930
Do ya mind if I have your phone?

1098
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:58,980
Go ahead and unlock it for me.

1099
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:02,770
Thank you. Hey, sorry for crashin' the party like we did

1100
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,520
but we have a few questions we wanna ask ya.

1101
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:06,320
- Is that all right with you? - Sure.

1102
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,990
- You're shakin'. Are you okay? - I'm fine.

1103
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:09,450
- You nervous? - Little bit.

1104
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:11,030
- Do you need anything? - No, we're good.

1105
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:13,410
If you tell me the truth, you're outta here in ten seconds.

1106
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:14,990
- Yes, sir. - If you lie to me,

1107
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,080
we're gonna have some problems.

1108
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,000
Yes, sir.

1109
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,710
You know Willa Ferguson, right?

1110
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:20,710
- I do. - How do you know her?

1111
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:21,750
We're good friends.

1112
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:23,790
Okay. Do you know where she is right now?

1113
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,050
I'm not sure.

1114
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:27,460
When's the last time you saw her?

1115
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,680
Uh, I saw her at the dance.

1116
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:33,140
Before you guys came in to the dance.

1117
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,930
What's her number?

1118
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:37,180
She doesn't have a phone.

1119
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:40,350
Her dad doesn't let her, so...

1120
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:43,100
The only high school girl in America,

1121
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:45,190
Willa Ferguson, doesn't have a phone.

1122
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:47,690
I guess so.

1123
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:01,580
Alpha Two, I need a residential address

1124
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,370
for a Sergio St. Carlos.

1125
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:09,760
What is it?

1126
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:11,720
It's an old tracking device.

1127
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,180
It goes off when it's within 100 yards of hers,

1128
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,680
if it works. And it never works.

1129
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,680
Sometimes it does, but mostly it doesn't.

1130
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:20,640
What about her phone?

1131
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,770
She doesn't have a phone.

1132
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:29,780
- What, she has a phone? - Yes.

1133
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:32,400
She's on... You have her phone number, man?

1134
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:34,610
No. Everybody knows she has a phone, though.

1135
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,740
Everybody knows she has a...

1136
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,330
Why didn't she tell me she has a phone?

1137
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:38,620
Maybe she didn't want you to get mad.

1138
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,330
She's not allowed to have a goddamn phone!

1139
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:42,000
Well, maybe she didn't want you to get mad.

1140
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,290
I don't get mad. I don't get mad about anything anymore.

1141
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:52,010
Scared?

1142
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:55,970
- No. - No?

1143
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,600
Well, you should be.

1144
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,850
Your dad ever mention Steve Lockjaw?

1145
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,350
Yeah.

1146
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,560
Yeah?

1147
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,110
What'd he tell you?

1148
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:13,610
He's the one who killed my mom.

1149
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,600
Let's fight fire with fire.

1150
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:48,860
Roger that.

1151
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,520
Net call, send in Eddie Van Halen.

1152
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,550
Personnel ready!

1153
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:24,350
Gas, gas, gas!

1154
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,740
Forward, move!

1155
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,320
Oh, my God.

1156
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:43,200
--

1157
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:50,040
BeeGee!

1158
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,460
What's the word?

1159
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,840
It's fuckin' World War III out there, yo!

1160
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:01,140
Meet me at Genesis, right now.

1161
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:09,350
They're with me. Okay?

1162
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,150
Help him bring everything inside, then meet me upstairs.

1163
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:13,150
Don't get locked out!

1164
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:18,150
Oh! Everybody. The store is closed.

1165
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,530
Help! Go help. Come on.

1166
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:21,030
- You got a charger, homie? - Let's go, give a hand.

1167
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:22,660
- Come on. We're closing. - Thank you. You speak English!

1168
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:23,950
- Thank you, bro. - Hey.

1169
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:27,330
We got 20 minutes to get everybody to the church. Okay?

1170
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:28,290
Okay.

1171
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:31,250
- I need your help. Okay? - Okay.

1172
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:33,420
I need you to go upstairs and do me a favor.

1173
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,590
I know you don't like the tunnel. You're gonna have to come with me.

1174
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:37,380
- Okay. Okay. - Go upstairs, give 'em a hand. Yeah.

1175
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,970
Esteban! Esteban, get off your phone. Ándale.

1176
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:42,550
Come to the front of the store and keep an eye on the store.

1177
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,430
- Esteban, vámonos! - Hey, get off the phone!

1178
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:47,180
- Get off the phone! Come on! - I'm not on the phone, man!

1179
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,430
God damn!

1180
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,020
I'm trying to charge the phone!

1181
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,310
- You see that? - Bring it upstairs.

1182
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:52,980
- Goddamn, man! - Bring it upstairs.

1183
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:22,800
Guys, clean it up. Spick-and-span.

1184
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:25,010
Bob.

1185
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:26,800
Not safe for you there. Follow me.

1186
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:31,930
Derrick, line 'em up in the hallway!

1187
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:34,270
- I'll be in 24!-

1188
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,490
You win some and you lose some, Bob.

1189
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:44,320
- Yeah. - Bob, Bob, Bob.

1190
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:45,570
Get back on defense.

1191
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:47,740
- Back on defense, man, yeah. - Yeah.

1192
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,240
Thank you, man. Thank you, thank you.

1193
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:52,250
Here.

1194
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:54,670
Do it in my room. It's more privacy.

1195
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:57,920
Aubrey, get off the phones. Go to the second floor.

1196
01:17:58,540 --> 01:17:59,840
- We're moving them out. - Where's your room?

1197
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:00,880
- Okay? - Back here, man?

1198
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,090
- Hey, Bob, Bob. - Back here?

1199
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:03,510
- Yeah? - This is everybody.

1200
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:05,300
- Yeah. Hi. - Everybody, this is Bob.

1201
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,140
- Hello, Bob. - The Gringo Zapata.

1202
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,510
Everyone, say hello.

1203
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,100
- Okay. Jacob... - Right on, man.

1204
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:11,430
I need you to go to the second floor.

1205
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,930
Marisela, we're moving them out.

1206
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,060
- What? - Now, now.

1207
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,940
Yeah. Bob, Bob. Bob. This is Rachel.

1208
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:18,520
- Hi, Rachel. How are you? - Rachel, this is Bob

1209
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,820
- and this is Landon, the newest one. - Hey, Landon.

1210
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:21,900
- How are you? - Hi.

1211
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:23,610
- Hey, is it back there? - Okay. Yeah. Back here.

1212
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:25,410
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

1213
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:26,910
Right here. Right behind the couch.

1214
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:28,280
Thank you, brother, thank you.

1215
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,700
Mariah. Madison. Come on.

1216
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:33,160
- Out. - Got it.

1217
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,290
Come on, it's my room.

1218
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:36,330
- - Thank you, girls.

1219
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,290
Yeah. Come on.

1220
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,050
Come on.

1221
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:47,930
Shit.

1222
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:52,890
Sorry, man.

1223
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,600
Come on.

1224
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,600
It's okay.

1225
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,230
Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

1226
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:00,690
Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

1227
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:05,990
I got power. I got power.

1228
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:16,040
Please, please, please.

1229
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:18,960
"Rise and shine."

1230
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,130
Hi. What's up?

1231
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,960
What's up, homie? It's me again. Bob Ferguson.

1232
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:29,180
I don't know if you remember, but we spoke earlier on the phone.

1233
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:32,180
I think we had a little misunderstanding.

1234
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:34,020
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

1235
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:37,560
I was trying to get the rendezvous point for my daughter. Willa.

1236
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,690
Right. If you can't answer "What time is it?"

1237
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:43,320
I cannot give you the rendezvous point.

1238
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,690
This is a key tenet of the rebellion text.

1239
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,990
-  "What time is it?" - I'm surprised you can't name it.

1240
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:48,650
- I don't know if you are... -

1241
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:49,820
...who you say you are.

1242
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:52,830
Well, look, look, maybe I can...

1243
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,620
Maybe I can give you some information

1244
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,620
and then you give me some information, all right?

1245
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,370
We'll just share a little bit of information.

1246
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,500
My name is Bob Ferguson.

1247
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:00,960
I don't know if you've ever heard of me. All right?

1248
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,420
I was a part of French 75 for years. Years and years, all right?

1249
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,760
They used to call me "Ghetto Pat," "Rocket Man," something like that.

1250
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:10,800
Only problem is, I, uh...

1251
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,930
I fried my brain since then, man.

1252
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,720
I have abused drugs and alcohol

1253
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:19,270
for the past 30 years, man.

1254
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:21,650
I'm a drug and alcohol lover

1255
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:24,900
and I cannot remember for the life of me,

1256
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:27,150
or the life of my only child,

1257
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,030
the answer to your question, "What time is it?"

1258
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:31,820
8:15.

1259
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:34,240
Now, I need this rendezvous point,

1260
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,660
you understand what I'm sayin'?

1261
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:37,580
- I need it. - I understand.

1262
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:39,580
- And the question is... - Fuck!

1263
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:41,080
..."What time is it?"

1264
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,710
If you don't give me the rendezvous point,

1265
01:20:43,790 --> 01:20:45,840
I swear to God, I will hunt you down

1266
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,920
and stick a loaded fuckin' hot piece of dynamite

1267
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:50,510
right up your fuckin' asshole.

1268
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:55,050
Okay, this doesn't feel safe. You're violating my space right now.

1269
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,220
Violating your space? Man, come on,

1270
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:58,980
what kind of revolutionary are you, brother?

1271
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:00,140
We're not even in the same room here.

1272
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,310
We're talkin' on the phone, like men!

1273
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:02,600
Rachel, let's take the boys outside...

1274
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:04,020
- Okay, there's no need to shout. - ...to the other room.

1275
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,520
This is a violation of my safety.

1276
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:06,980
These are noise triggers.

1277
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,360
Fuckin' noise triggers.

1278
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,070
Listen, I wanna know somethin'.

1279
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:12,240
I wanna know one thing when this is all said and done.

1280
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,990
What is your name? I need to know your name.

1281
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,240
- My name is Comrade Josh. - Yeah.

1282
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:18,200
Comrade Josh.

1283
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,910
Well, get a better name, Comrade Josh.

1284
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,170
That's a fuckin' ridiculous name for a revolutionary, first off.

1285
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:25,130
Second off, I wanna know your coordinates.

1286
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:27,750
I wanna know your location right now. What is it?

1287
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:31,220
I'm in a secure location, somewhere between

1288
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:35,260
the stolen land of the Wabanaki and the stolen land of the Chumash.

1289
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:37,430
You're fuckin' intolerable, man. You are...

1290
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:40,100
You really know... you're really intolerable, man.

1291
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:42,060
This is not the way the revolutionaries do shit.

1292
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:43,770
You know how hard you are to talk to?

1293
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:46,480
Do you know the information that I'm trying to give you?

1294
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,480
You're a little nitpicking prick!

1295
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,740
That's what you are, a little nitpicking prick.

1296

And you know what I'm gonna do to nitpicking pricks?

I'm callin' in a Greyhawk Ten. All right?

1300
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:01,700
I want you to get your supervisor

1301
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:03,580
on the phone right now, 'cause I know you got one.

1302
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:06,000
I know you got one, Comrade Josh. All right?

1303
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,920
Yeah, I'm goin' way over your fuckin' head.

1304
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,170
Way over your head. All right?

1305
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:12,260
Put your commanding officer on the phone now.

1306
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,880
Because you're calling in a Greyhawk Ten?

1307
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:17,050
I'm callin' in a Greyhawk Ten, Comrade Josh.

Please hold.

1309

Fuckin' prick. I got him.

1310

I got him right where I want him.

1311
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:27,060
That's some fucked-up, nitpickin' shit, Bob.

1312
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:29,570
He got you on one password.

Assholes.

01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:31,980
I'm sorry about...

1315

I brought all this shit to your door, man.

01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,570
You drop him off, you call me. Latino Heat, come with me!

1408
01:26:41,650 --> 01:26:43,110
No, no, no, man, I'm not goin' with them.

1409
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,360
No, I'm not goin' with them! I'm supposed to go with you.

1410
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:47,910
I need you, brother. Please, Sensei.

1411
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:49,030
Sensei, Sensei, please!

1412
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,080
Courage, Bob. Courage.

1413
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,160
That's it?

1414
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:56,460
Courage. Yeah. Yeah.

1415
01:26:57,670 --> 01:27:00,540
Thank you. Hey! Thank you, Sensei.

1416
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,550
Thank you, Sensei! Thank you!

1417
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:04,260
God damn it!

1418
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:06,010
¡Viva la revolución!

1419
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:11,350
¡Viva!

1420
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:22,730
This way, Bob!

1421
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,740
Pass me all your shit, man!

1422
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:27,700
Here.

1423
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:29,490
I don't give a shit what you do.

1424
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:31,530
I'm gonna need that number in the next ten seconds.

1425
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:32,990
I know nothing, sir.

1426
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:36,040
Do I look like your parent?

1427
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,420
- Kinda. - Give me the fuckin' number

1428
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,580
or stand up, put your hands behind your back.

1429
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:41,750
I don't have her phone number.

1430
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,840
Up. Put your hands behind your back.

1431
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:46,920
Cuff him. Get him outta here.

1432
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:49,390
I have it.

1433
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:51,220
You have it now?

1434
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:53,260
What is it?

1435
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:57,480
I thought you took AP Common Sense.

1436
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,690
Sit the fuck down.

1437
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:01,440
What's the number?

1438
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:03,610
It's under "Hello Kitty."

1439
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,240
Give it to me.

1440
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:13,870
Give it to me!

1441
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:18,500
I asked you if you had a phone.

1442
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:21,040
You looked me in my face, and you lied.

1443
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:25,590
I am here to save your fuckin' life. Do you understand?

1444
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:28,760
Don't lie to me again.

1445
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:35,720
Alpha Two's on the horn!

1446
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:38,770
The female's handset's heading south on 135.

1447
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:48,820
Freeze.

Cell One, Exfil.

1449
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:56,620
All right.

1450
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:39,330
¡Ándale, Bob! ¡Vamos, vamos!

- BeeGee. - Sensei,

1454
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:26,920
your guy fell off the roof and got arrested.

1455
01:30:27,790 --> 01:30:28,880
What the fuck happened?

1456
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:32,170
He fell 40 feet and fuckin' fell in a tree, man.

1457
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:33,970
Chota got him with a Taser.

1458
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:35,510
And my rifle?

1459
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:36,590
It's with me.

1460
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:37,680
Okay.

1461
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:40,430
Meet me at Sacred Heart.

Rochelle.

1464
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:43,580
Well, Deandra, what new mischief now?

1465
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:45,700
I have the child Willa Ferguson.

1466
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:48,830
This is Perfidia Beverly Hills' daughter.

1467
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:52,500
I'm comin' to you in an hour of need and desperation for safekeeping.

1468
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:02,430
Unbelievable.

1469
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,020
Do I look just like her?

1470
01:32:05,970 --> 01:32:08,350
No. Not really.

1471
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:11,770
But you do on the inside.

1472
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:15,980
Which makes you quite a risk around here.

1473
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:22,490
The daughter of a rat is a baby rat.

1474
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:25,910
And we must be careful.

1475
01:32:29,370 --> 01:32:30,500
Can you cook?

1476
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,500
Yes.

1477
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:35,960
We will not allow residence to anyone

1478
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:41,300
who cannot take responsibility for both her input and output.

1479
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:45,180
I can earn what I eat and secure what I shit,

1480
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,600
if that's what you mean.

1481
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,020
That's what I mean.

1482
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:55,730
Sister Vox, show Baby Perfidia to the Pancho Villa room.

1483
01:32:57,070 --> 01:32:58,030
A'ight.

1484
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:00,610
Let me run shit down to you.

1485
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,530
So you have the towels over here.

1486
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:04,490
The bathroom is straight through there.

1487
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:06,740
The pillows is right there, as you can see.

1488
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:10,500
And don't ask for the fuckin' Wi-Fi, 'cause we ain't got none.

1489
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:12,540
Make yourself at home, Goldilocks.

1490
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,090
What does she know?

1491
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:26,010
She thinks her mom was a hero.

1492
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,020
And I...

1493
01:33:31,270 --> 01:33:33,440
I didn't have the guts to tell her the truth.

1494
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:37,400
I couldn't.

1495
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:41,490
Perfidia Beverly Hills

1496
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:46,280
is a problem that keeps on givin'.

1497
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:51,080
This revolution doesn't need another one of her runnin' around.

1498
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:53,830
Shit's hard enough.

1499
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:02,340
You got more fight in you than the rest of us, Deandra.

1500
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:07,180

1546
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,540
So... what's cookin'?

1547
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:46,800
How can I help?

1548
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,380
Well, Tim,

1549
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,180
there's this troubling little rumor we've just heard.

1550
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,470
And we brought you in

1551
01:36:53,550 --> 01:36:54,930
to see if you can help clear it up.

1552
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:57,970
I'm gonna hand you over to Bill. He'll give you the details.

1553
01:36:58,060 --> 01:36:59,640
- Over to you, Bill. - All right.

1554
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:01,900
Tim, I'm gonna get right to it. Um...

1555
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:05,070
There's an unconfirmed report

1556
01:37:05,150 --> 01:37:07,360
that Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw

1557
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,950
is the father of a mixed-race child.

1558
01:37:13,660 --> 01:37:15,780
Which mix?

1559
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,830
There's no real easy way to say this, but...

1560
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:22,830
Yeah.

1561
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:24,880
It's Black.

1562
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,220
Well, uh...

1563
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:38,520
that would be quite the revelation if it were true.

1564
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:42,940
Bill, may I ask what your source is?

1565
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:47,320
Sure. That's part of a Double Yankee White background check.

1566
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:49,900
Some old paperwork turned up in a computer file

1567
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:53,490
on the Black militant named Junglepussy.

1568
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:58,080
She told an officer this very story 15 years ago.

1569
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:00,250
Fifteen years ago.

1570
01:38:00,790 --> 01:38:03,370
It's been there the whole time, in ancient file.

1571
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,130
Pure luck we caught it.

1572
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:07,750
So where's the Pussy?

1573
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:08,960
Oh, she's long dead.

1574
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,550
Oh. No more Pussy.

1575
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:13,300
Now, a few days ago,

1576
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:15,300
Lockjaw hired a bounty hunter

1577
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:18,140
to make a civilian extraction in El Paso.

1578
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:21,390
It was led by an Avanti Q. You know him?

1579
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:23,520
Yeah, I know Avanti. He's a good soldier.

1580
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:24,940
Not great?

1581
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,860
I mean, he's excellent, but he's not a native son.

1582
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:30,190
That's his dirty little secret.

1583
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,820
He passes for half-Mexican,

1584
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:33,780
but he's actually part Comanche

1585
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:35,490
or, I don't know, Eskimo.

1586
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:37,320
He's a fantastic tracker.

1587
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:40,200
He'll tell you how much money someone had in their pocket

1588
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:42,580
based on a footprint, but he is not homegrown,

1589
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:44,120
so I would not trust it.

1590
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,580
Yeah, well,

1591
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:49,040
he's apparently good enough to find what Lockjaw was lookin' for.

1592
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:50,050
Yeah.

1593
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:53,260
He found Howard Sommerville.

1594
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:57,640
Ex-French 75. He runs an underground railroad,

1595
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:00,470
bringing illegals from our southern border

1596
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,270
to Baktan Cross in the north,

1597
01:39:02,350 --> 01:39:04,810
where he set up a so-called sanctuary city,

1598
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:08,060
giving jobs and housing to drug dealers and psychopaths.

1599
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:10,770
He's also a reefer addict.

1600
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:13,940
Really? Well, he sounds like a class act, this guy.

1601
01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:16,280
Next thing we know, Colonel Lockjaw's mobilized

1602
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,410
his task force into Baktan Cross

1603
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:23,450
and conducted a Class-A raid on the Chicken Lickin' Frozen Farm.

1604
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:26,670
Oh, no. I love their nuggets.

1605
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:30,000
Well, this could mean a nugget shortage.

1606
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:32,630
Not to mention the Chicken Lickin's owned

1607
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:34,550
by our fellow Christmas Adventurer,

1608
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:38,050
Brother Burt Rimhorn, who wants his wetbacks back to work.

1609
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:39,800
Next...

1610
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:41,720
He hit the high school, Tim.

1611
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:42,970
Yeah.

1612
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,520
The high school.

1613
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:49,350
And now, all hell's broken loose on the streets of Baktan Cross.

1614
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,270
And he's turned off his A-TAK's.

1615
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,190
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think I'm pickin' up

1616
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:54,820
what you gents are layin' down here.

1617
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:56,650
This is a curious chain of events.

1618
01:39:57,860 --> 01:40:00,530
So Lockjaw's lookin' for his half-breed,

1619
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:03,120
but do we know where the mama bear is?

1620
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,740
Funny you should ask that.

1621
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:09,330
Perfidia Beverly Hills.

1622
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:13,130
Currently M.I.A. Former French 75.

1623
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:16,170
She went into witness protection about 15 years ago,

1624
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:18,760
only to disappear.

1625
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,300
The arresting agent...

1626
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:23,260
Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw.

1627
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:26,980
Agency sightings have her in Cuba or Algiers,

1628
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:28,440
depending on the report.

1629
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:29,560
So...

1630
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:33,230
not the mothering type, I take it.

1631
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,940
And they call us the savages.

1632
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:40,990
Lockjaw got his dick dirty.

1633
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:45,160
He needs to clean it.

1634
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,500
If he can find this kid,

1635
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:52,630
he can dispose of the evidence,

1636
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:56,960
and continue to make fools out of all of us.

1637
01:41:01,010 --> 01:41:03,010
What would you like me to do, sir?

1638
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:09,930
Tim, given your expertise in family cases,

1639
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:12,060
- we felt that maybe-- - Make it clean.

1640
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:16,400
Clean?

1641
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:20,740
We should all be able to eat off the floor.

1642
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:24,450
Yeah. It's that clean.

1643
01:41:25,870 --> 01:41:26,950
Yes, sir.

1644
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:31,250
Well, all right, gents.

1645
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,250
Looks like I'm headed west.

1646
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:36,290
- And may Saint Nick be with you. - Ah.

1647
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,960
All hail Saint Nick.

1648
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,950
I have something to ask you, okay?

1649
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:13,960
'Kay.

1650
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,000
Was she a rat?

1651
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,340
Yeah, she was.

1652
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:29,510
My dad told me she was a hero.

1653
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:32,810
Hey, stop banging your head.

1654
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:35,230
- Stop banging your head.-

1655
01:42:35,310 --> 01:42:37,610
- Stop banging your head on that. - Okay.

1656
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:40,280
- Sir, do you know your last name? - No.

1657
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:43,240
- What's your last name?-

1658
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:44,820
Batman.

1659
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:46,610
Okay, come on. I need to know your real last name.

1660
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:49,740
Um, Parker. Peter Parker, man.

1661
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:50,830
- Peter Parker. - Yeah.

1662
01:42:50,910 --> 01:42:52,120
All right, listen. This is your last chance.

1663
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,290
If you don't give me your real last name,

1664
01:42:53,370 --> 01:42:54,460
it's gonna be another charge. What is it?

1665
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:56,830
Okay, okay. Stop harassing me, for God sakes!

1666
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:59,840
Parker. Jim Parker, man.

1667
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,340
- Your name's Jim Parker? - Yeah.

1668
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:02,960
Okay, Jim. What's your date of birth?

1669
01:43:03,050 --> 01:43:05,170
I'm somewhere in the '80s, man.

1670
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:06,800
- In the '80s. - Yeah.

1671
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:09,180
Let's go. You're up.

1672
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:10,810
- - Let's go.

1673
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:14,980
- - Get up. Well, fuck.

1674
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:19,560
Sit down there.

1675
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:24,190
Mr. Jim Parker, is that correct?

1676
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:25,650
Forty-two years old?

1677
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:28,530
Sir, she's gonna be taking your vitals behind you, okay?

1678
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,370
Mr. Parker.

1679
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,410
Mr. Parker, over here.

1680
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:34,250
Do you have any medical problems?

1681
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:36,790
- Yeah. - Mr. Parker,

1682
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:38,080
can you look at me, sir?

1683
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,170
Bob. Can you look at me?

1684
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,500
Are you diabetic?

1685
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,050
Are you diabetic?

1686
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:48,890
Uh-huh.

1687
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:50,180
Yeah.

1688
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:52,260
Did you take your insulin yesterday?

1689
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:57,600
You know, if you're a bad hombre,

1690
01:43:57,690 --> 01:44:00,440
you make sure you take your insulin on a daily basis. Right?

1691
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:03,940
Officer, we're not gonna be able to take this one.

1692
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:05,280
He needs to go out to the ER.

1693
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:08,070
Thank you, sir. Have a good day.

1694
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,780
- Hey, how's it goin'? - Good. How are you?

1695
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:12,030
Good, thanks.

1696
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:17,000
Mr. Parker, here's your restroom, okay?

1697
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:18,410
Let's check your sugar.

1698
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:22,750
You are gonna go through the bathroom,

1699
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:25,420
straight down the hall to the right

1700
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:26,840
to the fire escape.

1701
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,010
Right now.

1702
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:30,260

Buddha bean.

1738
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:56,100
Sir, I'm Colonel Steve Lockjaw.

1739
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:57,470
I'm not to be fucked with.

1740
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,350
You got information for me, spit it out.

1741
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:01,980
I saw a car, a gray van heading north,

1742
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:03,190
up Craw Creek Road.

1743
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:05,190
- Carrying? - Couldn't tell.

1744
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:07,320
White man driving, Black girl passenger.

1745
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:09,440
North.

1746
01:46:12,030 --> 01:46:13,030
What's in these hills?

1747
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:15,530
Sisters of the Brave Beaver.

1748
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:16,660
Who are they?

1749
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:19,330
They grow weed. They're nuns.

1750
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:22,620
Is that some kind of sick joke on God?

1751
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:23,960
I'm not joking.

1752
01:46:25,710 --> 01:46:27,000
How many women?

1753
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:29,340
I don't know. A bunch. Ten or 20.

1754
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:32,300
Weapons?

1755
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:34,550
I think they're vegetarian.

1756
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:40,060
Men, let's do what we do.

1757
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:43,060
Delta-Two, this is Delta-One.

1758
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:44,390
We need to pull imagery.

1759
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:47,060
Mountain chain, ten kilometers northwest. How copy?

1760
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:28,980
Hands, hands, hands!

1761
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:54,590
Dismissed.

1762
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:10,560
Come closer.

1763
01:49:47,490 --> 01:49:50,250
If this doesn't line up, you'll go free.

1764
01:49:53,830 --> 01:49:55,250
But if it does line up...

1765
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:58,550
if this is a straight line...

1766
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:01,170
you got a problem.

1767
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:06,470
What is it?

1768
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:08,260
It's your future.

1769
01:50:34,620 --> 01:50:35,960
How old are you now?

1770
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:42,340
Hm?

1771
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:46,050
You're 16 or 17. It's either one of those.

1772
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:53,100
You have a boyfriend?

1773
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:54,810
I don't have anything to say to you.

1774
01:50:54,890 --> 01:50:56,310
You're too young to have a boyfriend,

1775
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,230
so the answer's no.

1776
01:50:57,310 --> 01:50:58,810
Don't answer for me.

1777
01:51:00,110 --> 01:51:01,820
It all makes sense.

1778
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,070
You snag her out of the high school.

1779
01:51:05,780 --> 01:51:08,530
Find her phone. Curb stomp that.

1780
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:12,950
But then you fumble her on the 90-yard line

1781
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:15,500
at some stank-ass nunnery? Mm!

1782
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:17,540
That's gotta hurt.

1783
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:20,380
You help me, I'll help you.

1784
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:23,380
You give me Pat Calhoun...

1785
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:27,180
the Rocket Man, Ghetto Pat...

1786
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:30,720
and I'll let you go home, and I'll let you save that little girl.

1787
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:33,140
You know she's with the Colonel, right?

1788
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:37,940
By "home"...

1789
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:40,020
I do mean federal prison for you.

1790
01:51:49,990 --> 01:51:51,200
Did you rape her?

1791
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,620
Do you think you're my daughter?

1792
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:01,670
Did you love her?

1793
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,050
Answer me!

1794
01:52:05,130 --> 01:52:06,920
Do you think you're my daughter?

1795
01:52:07,010 --> 01:52:08,470
It doesn't matter what that test says.

1796
01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:10,050
I have a father, and it's not you.

1797
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:12,640
Is that what you call a father? He wasn't enough for your mother.

1798
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:14,140
How's he gonna be enough for you?

1799
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:15,770
Hm?

1800
01:52:26,190 --> 01:52:27,240
{\an8} Where is he?

1801
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:30,820
I swear, I don't know. I don't know.

1802
01:52:30,910 --> 01:52:32,200
Deandra, you know how many people

1803
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:34,540
sit across from me and swear to God...

1804
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:37,160
they don't know?

1805
01:52:38,290 --> 01:52:39,920
"I swear to God, I don't know."

1806
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:43,790
I swear to God...

1807
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:47,010
if you do know, we can save that girl.

1808
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,880
The girl didn't do anything, and I don't know.

1809
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:51,470
I don't know where he is.

1810
01:52:51,550 --> 01:52:53,850
If I knew where he was, I would tell you. I don't know where he is.

1811
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:55,220
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1812
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:56,430
Where is he?

1813
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,310
Save yourself, go to prison,

1814
01:52:58,390 --> 01:53:01,350
I'll take it to the Colonel, you save the girl.

1815
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,980
Those are your options. You're in a lose-lose,

1816
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:06,480
maybe-save-your-life position.

1817
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:16,580
You should put on more makeup to make yourself look better.

1818
01:53:19,290 --> 01:53:22,790
You go to a dance, you make an effort.

1819
01:53:23,580 --> 01:53:25,130
You put on more makeup.

1820
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:34,300
Why is your shirt so tight?

1821
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:43,600
I'm not gay, if that's what you're sayin'.

1822
01:53:43,690 --> 01:53:44,860
I didn't say that.

1823
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:46,650
I'm not a homosexual.

1824
01:53:46,730 --> 01:53:47,860
I did not say that,

1825
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:49,690
but I see the lifts in your shoes.

1826
01:53:50,530 --> 01:53:54,490
Oh, you are a smartass. You... Oh, yeah, yeah.

1827
01:53:54,570 --> 01:53:58,080
You just, you're just a little princess, aren't you?

1828
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:00,830
Smart mouth. Like your mother.

1829
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:03,420
Your mother had a smart mouth, and I buried her.

1830
01:54:11,670 --> 01:54:14,890
Are you having trouble remembering what you just read?

1831
01:54:14,970 --> 01:54:16,760
If it's a straight line, I have a problem.

1832
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:18,140
If it's not, you have to let me go.

1833
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:21,140
God, there's no way I'm actually yours, 'cause I can actually fucking read.

1834
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:23,190
You shut up. Just shut up!

1835
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:25,480
You fucking mutt!

1836
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:45,920
Uh-oh.

1837
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:07,060
Get my vehicle.

1838
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:09,020
- Put my kid in the car.-

1839
01:55:14,190 --> 01:55:17,490
Just never thought this fucker would come back for us, you know?

1840
01:55:20,030 --> 01:55:22,700
I got lazy, man. I wasn't payin' attention.

1841
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:30,170
I thought the person comin' through that door one day

1842
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:32,800
was gonna be her mom, not this fuckin' asshole.

1843
01:55:34,090 --> 01:55:35,260
Hm.

1844
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:38,550
See her daughter, you know, she'd teach her girl stuff,

1845
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:41,890
she'd do her hair, she'd...

1846
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:45,730
be a mom.

1847
01:55:50,810 --> 01:55:52,690
I can't do her hair, man.

1848
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:55,150
You know that?

1849
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:59,030
I don't know how to do her hair right.

1850
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:00,370
Well...

1851
01:56:05,910 --> 01:56:07,540
Don't go dark on me, Bob.

1852
01:56:12,130 --> 01:56:13,210
I won't.

1853
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:16,470
I'm here. I'm here.

1854
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:20,510
Bring it down, bro.

1855
01:56:21,470 --> 01:56:22,720
Motherfucker.

1856
01:56:24,350 --> 01:56:25,180
Here he comes.

1857
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,110
Put this in your backpack.

1858
01:56:46,290 --> 01:56:48,160
Guess this is the end of the line, huh?

1859
01:56:49,870 --> 01:56:51,250
Not for you.

1860
01:56:52,330 --> 01:56:55,630
Ocean waves. Ocean waves.

1861
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:00,760
I gotta ditch you, Kemosabe.

1862
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:02,680
- What? - You gotta hit it on foot.

1863
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:04,300
- On foot? - Yeah.

1864
01:57:05,810 --> 01:57:06,930
Here we go.

1865
01:57:07,930 --> 01:57:11,350
I'm gonna turn at this gas station, I'm gonna slow down,

1866
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:13,770
and you tuck and roll. I'll take it from there.

1867
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:14,900
Unbuckle and get ready.

1868
01:57:14,980 --> 01:57:16,650
- Tuck and roll. - Yeah.

1869
01:57:16,730 --> 01:57:17,650
Okay.

1870
01:57:18,530 --> 01:57:20,700
- You know what freedom is? - What?

1871
01:57:21,450 --> 01:57:24,200
No fear.

1872
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:27,330
Just like Tom fuckin' Cruise.

1873
01:57:29,870 --> 01:57:31,830
Okay. Jump on four. One...

1874
01:57:34,290 --> 01:57:35,420
...two...

1875
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:37,670
Give me the gun!

1876
01:57:39,670 --> 01:57:41,300
...three...

1877
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:43,930
Go! Go!

1878
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:44,890
Four!

1879
01:57:44,970 --> 01:57:46,350
Slow down!

1880
01:57:46,430 --> 01:57:49,100
Go! Four, Bob!

1881
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:51,020
Go, four!

1882
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:22,780
Get up! We're leaving.

1883
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:35,620
Making up for lost time? Little daddy-daughter games?

1884
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:37,120
Daddy-daughter games?

1885
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:45,920
I am a Christmas Adventurer!

1886
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:47,720
Do you know what that is?

1887
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:49,090
No!

1888
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:51,220
I have a higher calling.

1889
01:59:55,390 --> 01:59:59,650
It is a higher honor than having you.

1890
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:42,060
- - Contact, contact! 12 o'clock!

1891
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:31,450
I loved her, in case you were wonderin'.

1892
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:37,240
Best goddamn-looking witch I ever saw.

1893
02:01:37,330 --> 02:01:38,370
Shut up.

1894
02:01:38,450 --> 02:01:40,040
Yeah, she was possessed.

1895
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:41,920
- Shut the fuck up. - She was insane.

1896
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,880
Like you. You have it in you.

1897
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:45,250
I smelled it from within her,

1898
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:46,630
and I can smell it from within you.

1899
02:01:46,710 --> 02:01:47,800
She was a fucking rat.

1900
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:51,510
She was a warrior, a righteous warrior of freedom!

1901
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:53,640
And she fought the weak!

1902
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:55,100
She was a fucking rat!

1903
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:57,930
Huh? Huh?

1904
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:00,310
You should respect your mother and your father both.

1905
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:03,440
Poke your fuckin' eyes out.

1906
02:03:11,170 --> 02:03:12,380
Avanti.

1907
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:14,840
How's the bounty business?

1908
02:03:15,970 --> 02:03:17,340
It's all right. How's it with you?

1909
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:19,550
Things could be better.

1910
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:22,020
It's not one thing, it's a-fuckin'-nother.

1911
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:23,560
Do you find that to be true?

1912
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:26,980
Anyway...

1913
02:03:27,850 --> 02:03:29,690
I need to dispose of this one.

1914
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:32,360
Who is it?

1915
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:34,610
Murder suspect. Wetback half-breed.

1916
02:03:34,690 --> 02:03:37,320
Involved in narco cartels. Nobody that will be missed.

1917
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:39,910
That's a kid. I don't do kids.

1918
02:03:39,990 --> 02:03:41,200
Kids do bad shit.

1919
02:03:42,830 --> 02:03:43,700
Why don't you do it?

1920
02:03:43,790 --> 02:03:45,460
I can't do it. I'm busy. So who can do it?

1921
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:46,830
Well, get Erik Garrow to do it.

1922
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:48,040
I don't want Erik Garrow to do it.

1923
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:50,000
I'll pay you double your daily rate, get this done.

1924
02:03:50,090 --> 02:03:52,050
I don't give a shit. I'm not doin' it.

1925
02:03:52,130 --> 02:03:53,210
All right.

1926
02:03:54,970 --> 02:03:56,760
You know the 1776,

1927
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:58,890
about five miles outside Del Rio by Walter's Landing?

1928
02:03:58,970 --> 02:04:00,140
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1929
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:02,350
You get her to them, I'll pay you your daily rate.

1930
02:04:22,490 --> 02:04:23,620
Smart aleck.

1931
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:54,900
You got no manners, God damn it!

1932
02:04:55,820 --> 02:04:57,530
You weren't raised right!

1933
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:00,860
You see that?!

1934
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:02,240
You see that?!

1935
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:05,660
That's what your mother brought up.

1936
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:12,130
Get... there.

1937
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:14,130
Kick all the way. Yeah, go ahead, kick!

1938
02:05:14,210 --> 02:05:16,380
- Kick, kick!-

1939
02:05:16,460 --> 02:05:18,420
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

1940
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:21,760
If you had any manners, we might have gotten to know each other.

1941
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:24,220
--

1942
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:38,030
Little bitch child.

1943
02:05:38,860 --> 02:05:40,240
Bitch child.

1944
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:43,030
All goddamn witches...

1945
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:50,330
Where the fuck are you taking me, asshole?

1946
02:05:51,250 --> 02:05:53,330
Someone gonna come by lookin' for you?

1947
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:58,840
I said, is someone gonna come by lookin' for you?

1948
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,090
Yeah.

1949
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:06,260
They're gonna find me, and they're gonna fuck you up.

1950
02:06:15,190 --> 02:06:17,270
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Come on.

1951
02:06:18,530 --> 02:06:21,030
Fuck! Fuck!

1952
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:32,830
Hola, hola.

1953
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:54,940
Head.

1954
02:07:02,990 --> 02:07:05,410
All right, lift your shirt and turn around.

1955
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:09,280
Put your hands on top of your head.

1956
02:07:11,540 --> 02:07:13,000
All right, let's go to work.

1957
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:16,790
Do not move. Do you have any weapons on you, sir?

1958
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,080
No, sir.

1959
02:07:18,170 --> 02:07:19,540
Why are you running from us?

1960
02:07:20,710 --> 02:07:22,210
Had a long day, ma'am.

1961
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:23,630
You didn't see the lights back there?

1962
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:24,800
Yes, I did.

1963
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:26,630
What did you toss out of the vehicle?

1964
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:27,680
'Scuse me?

1965
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:29,470
What did you toss out of the vehicle back there?

1966
02:07:30,470 --> 02:07:32,470
- Trash. - You sure about that?

1967
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:33,560
Yes, ma'am.

1968
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:35,140
You been drinking today?

1969
02:07:35,230 --> 02:07:37,350
- I've had a few. - A few what?

1970
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:39,270
Few small beers.

1971
02:08:08,010 --> 02:08:09,010
There you are.

1972
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:11,640
I see you.

1973
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:12,970
I see you.

1974
02:08:14,640 --> 02:08:16,850
I got you, motherfucker, I got you.

1975
02:08:18,690 --> 02:08:21,900
Faster, you fuckin' piece of shit! Go!

1976
02:08:34,620 --> 02:08:35,950
Who's this asshole?

1977
02:08:38,830 --> 02:08:40,040
What do you want?

1978
02:09:33,890 --> 02:09:35,050
Is that from Lockjaw?

1979
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:51,200
We got a body.

1980
02:09:55,990 --> 02:09:57,370
Copy, copy.

1981
02:10:01,290 --> 02:10:02,750
Thanks, wagon-burner.

1982
02:10:37,410 --> 02:10:38,950
Fuck.

1983
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:43,290
Fuck.

1984
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:48,290
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1985
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:49,710
God damn it.

1986
02:10:52,010 --> 02:10:54,010
Fuck. Fuck!

1987
02:12:49,670 --> 02:12:51,500
Hey, fuckstick, what are ya doin'?

1988
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,210
Hey, Red, I know you hear me.

1989
02:12:57,470 --> 02:12:59,680
That firewater's got you fuckin' retarded.

1990
02:13:46,470 --> 02:13:47,720
Oh, God.

1991
02:14:15,540 --> 02:14:18,460
"Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies,

1992
02:14:18,550 --> 02:14:20,130
and Hooterville Junction!

1993
02:14:21,380 --> 02:14:23,550
Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies,

1994
02:14:23,630 --> 02:14:25,340
and Hooterville Junction!

1995
02:14:27,890 --> 02:14:29,020
Green..."

1996
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:31,770
Willa!

1997
02:15:44,510 --> 02:15:45,880
Fuck.

1998
02:16:00,860 --> 02:16:02,650
Please, please. Okay. Okay.

1999
02:19:42,620 --> 02:19:43,620
Fuck!

2000
02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:09,900
"Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies,

2001
02:20:09,980 --> 02:20:11,520
and Hooterville Junction!"

2002
02:20:13,980 --> 02:20:14,900
What?!

2003
02:20:14,990 --> 02:20:17,490
"Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies,

2004
02:20:17,570 --> 02:20:19,200
and Hooterville Junction!"

2005
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:20,450
I don't know--

2006
02:20:20,990 --> 02:20:22,410
- - Say it!

2007
02:21:38,190 --> 02:21:39,360
Willa?

2008
02:21:41,610 --> 02:21:42,530
Willa!

2009
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:44,030
"Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies,

2010
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:45,950
- and Hooterville Junction!" - No, no, no, baby, it's me.

2011
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:46,950
Willa, it's...

2012
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:49,830
"Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies, and Hooterville Junction!"

2013
02:21:49,910 --> 02:21:51,670
Okay! Okay!

2014
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,540
It's your dad, Willa!

2015
02:21:56,630 --> 02:21:59,470
"Will no longer be so goddamn relevant." Look at me.

2016
02:22:02,430 --> 02:22:03,970
Who are you?

2017
02:22:06,180 --> 02:22:07,510
It's your dad!

2018
02:22:10,100 --> 02:22:11,140
Look at me.

2019
02:22:12,020 --> 02:22:14,400
It's okay. It's okay.

2020
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:21,530
Are you okay? Are you okay?

2021
02:22:21,610 --> 02:22:24,780
Are you okay? Come on. Go to the car. Go!

2022
02:22:36,670 --> 02:22:38,170
Let's go. Let's go.

2023
02:22:51,980 --> 02:22:53,270
Oh, my God.

2024
02:22:59,530 --> 02:23:01,490
You're okay now. You're okay.

2025
02:23:47,110 --> 02:23:48,660
Do you know a Black militant

2026
02:23:48,740 --> 02:23:51,160
by the name of Perfidia Beverly Hills?

2027
02:23:51,240 --> 02:23:53,040
- Yes, I do. - Uh-huh.

2028
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:56,290
And was she a member of the rebel group known as the French 75?

2029
02:23:56,370 --> 02:23:58,040
- She was. - Yeah.

2030
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:01,710
Colonel Lockjaw...

2031
02:24:03,630 --> 02:24:06,720
did you engage in a romantic relationship with this woman?

2032
02:24:13,430 --> 02:24:15,310
Gentlemen...

2033
02:24:15,390 --> 02:24:19,440
I have engaged the enemy face-to-face in battle.

2034
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:23,780
And in the dark alleys and shadows of espionage.

2035
02:24:26,740 --> 02:24:30,620
I was once raped in reverse.

2036
02:24:34,040 --> 02:24:35,410
Raped in reverse?

2037
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:41,960
Could you explain how that might work for us, Colonel Lockjaw?

2038
02:24:42,040 --> 02:24:45,510
The enemy employed deception. I was drugged.

2039
02:24:46,720 --> 02:24:48,470
And while unconscious...

2040
02:24:49,930 --> 02:24:52,010
my brain was not working.

2041
02:24:53,470 --> 02:24:56,850
But my power was, and I believe it was taken advantage of.

2042
02:24:59,140 --> 02:25:00,520
What kind of proof do you have?

2043
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:02,770
If you were unconscious, how do you know this to be true?

2044
02:25:02,860 --> 02:25:04,900
I don't know it to be true, but I suspect it.

2045
02:25:04,980 --> 02:25:07,860
When I awoke, there was sensitivity in a private place,

2046
02:25:07,950 --> 02:25:10,450
and there was some residue of an interaction.

2047
02:25:12,320 --> 02:25:13,870
Interaction?

2048
02:25:14,410 --> 02:25:16,160
I believe she was a sperm thief.

2049
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:20,040
A semen demon.

2050
02:25:20,120 --> 02:25:21,210
That's correct.

2051
02:25:21,290 --> 02:25:22,580
Colonel Lockjaw,

2052
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:26,800
what would be the purpose of the enemy raping you in reverse?

2053
02:25:29,170 --> 02:25:31,800
They saw the power of my mind and body.

2054
02:25:32,890 --> 02:25:34,140
They desired it.

2055
02:25:44,900 --> 02:25:46,400
Congratulations, Steve.

2056
02:25:48,780 --> 02:25:50,780
You're a Christmas Adventurer.

2057
02:25:50,860 --> 02:25:53,200
Oh, Mommy. Thank you, sir.

2058
02:25:54,320 --> 02:25:56,660
Let me show you around southwest headquarters.

2059
02:25:56,740 --> 02:25:57,950
- Sure. - Should we go for a walk?

2060
02:25:58,040 --> 02:25:59,000
Yes, sir.

2061
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:02,000
First stop on the tour, your new office.

2062
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:03,170
Oh, my.

2063
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:07,210
You know, if I'm being honest, Sandy,

2064
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:10,010
there was a minute there where I didn't think I was gonna make it.

2065
02:26:10,090 --> 02:26:12,300
Lockjaw, we're lucky to have you.

2066
02:26:12,380 --> 02:26:14,470
Now, obviously, goes without saying,

2067
02:26:14,550 --> 02:26:17,390
this is just one place where you can hang your hat,

2068
02:26:17,470 --> 02:26:20,270
take meetings, stow a few personal items.

2069
02:26:20,350 --> 02:26:23,400
We like our members to feel they have a home away from home,

2070
02:26:23,480 --> 02:26:24,650
any time, day or night.

2071
02:26:24,730 --> 02:26:26,320
That's a fine idea.

2072
02:26:26,400 --> 02:26:29,780
Now, it's empty right now, but we'll let you personalize it.

2073
02:26:29,860 --> 02:26:31,860
A man's taste defines him, doesn't it?

2074
02:26:31,950 --> 02:26:33,320
It does indeed, sir.

2075
02:26:33,410 --> 02:26:35,780
And here we are.

2076
02:26:35,870 --> 02:26:37,370
Suite 55.

2077
02:26:40,790 --> 02:26:42,000
Look at that view.

2078
02:26:43,830 --> 02:26:45,130
Would you look at that?

2079
02:26:46,750 --> 02:26:48,380
- May I? - Absolutely.

2080
02:26:56,010 --> 02:26:58,760
- - Damn it. I forgot your keys.

2081
02:26:58,850 --> 02:27:00,390
Wait here, I'll just grab 'em from my office.

2082
02:27:00,470 --> 02:27:01,640
Yes, sir.

2083
02:28:11,710 --> 02:28:14,550
I've been holding on to something for a while now

2084
02:28:14,630 --> 02:28:16,840
and I wanted to give it to you.

2085
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:19,050
Okay?

2086
02:28:20,350 --> 02:28:23,100
And I didn't give it to you before because I...

2087
02:28:24,310 --> 02:28:27,940
I just didn't wanna expose you to certain stuff.

2088
02:28:28,020 --> 02:28:29,810
You know, I didn't want you to feel...

2089
02:28:31,150 --> 02:28:33,440
sad or confused about it.

2090
02:28:35,690 --> 02:28:37,820
I don't know. I don't know what I wanted. I wanted...

2091
02:28:38,450 --> 02:28:40,160
I wanted to protect you.

2092
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:44,490
From all your mom's shit.

2093
02:28:45,330 --> 02:28:47,290
From all my shit.

2094
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:52,460
I just, I suppose I wanted to be the one

2095
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:55,130
that you came to for help, right?

2096
02:28:55,210 --> 02:28:56,800
You know, the one,

2097
02:28:57,670 --> 02:29:00,760
the cool dad that you could say anything to.

2098
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:05,560
Even though I know that's impossible.

2099
02:29:06,770 --> 02:29:08,480
But I don't want...

2100
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:12,020
I don't wanna lie to you about anything anymore.

2101
02:29:15,360 --> 02:29:16,490
And I've been holdin' on to somethin'

2102
02:29:16,570 --> 02:29:19,280
for a couple years now and I just wanna...

2103
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:21,200
I just wanna give it to you.

2104
02:29:22,120 --> 02:29:23,780
Okay, I'm gonna share this with you

2105
02:29:23,870 --> 02:29:27,660
and if you wanna see it, you can see it.

2106
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,040
Do you wanna see it?

2107
02:29:30,120 --> 02:29:31,750
I don't know what it is, Dad.

2108
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:34,420
- You don't know what it is? - No.

2109
02:29:37,340 --> 02:29:39,470
It's a letter.

2110
02:29:41,340 --> 02:29:42,970
It's a letter from your mom.

2111
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:47,390
Is it for me or for you?

2112
02:29:52,650 --> 02:29:53,770
It's for you.

2113
02:30:12,460 --> 02:30:13,880
You wanna go read it alone?

2114
02:30:13,960 --> 02:30:15,340
Go ahead.

2115
02:30:29,730 --> 02:30:31,180
Dear Charlene...

2116
02:30:32,190 --> 02:30:34,860
Hello from the other side of the shadows.

2117
02:30:36,310 --> 02:30:37,520
I don't mean to shock you,

2118
02:30:37,610 --> 02:30:40,240
but I've been contemplatin' writin' you for a long time.

2119
02:30:41,700 --> 02:30:46,160
I often wake up and I find it completely crazy how

2120
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:49,620
and why I am where I am today.

2121
02:30:49,700 --> 02:30:51,960
And disconnected from my family.

2122
02:30:53,870 --> 02:30:55,790
I pretended my whole life.

2123
02:30:57,130 --> 02:30:59,420
I pretended to be strong...

2124
02:30:59,500 --> 02:31:01,340
pretended to be dead.

2125
02:31:03,090 --> 02:31:06,930
Is it too late for us, after all my lies?

2126
02:31:09,010 --> 02:31:10,430
Are you happy?

2127
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:13,480
Do you have love?

2128
02:31:15,690 --> 02:31:17,770
What will you do when you get older?

2129
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:22,740
Will you try to change the world, like I did?

2130
02:31:24,530 --> 02:31:25,740
We failed.

2131
02:31:27,240 --> 02:31:28,620
But maybe you will not.

2132
02:31:30,370 --> 02:31:32,910
Maybe you will be the one who puts the world right.

2133
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:38,340
I think of you every single day...

2134
02:31:38,420 --> 02:31:40,300
every single day.

2135
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:44,470
And I wish I had been strong for the both of us.

2136
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:48,050
I know someday...

2137
02:31:49,140 --> 02:31:51,350
when it's right and it's safe...

2138
02:31:52,390 --> 02:31:53,980
you will find me.

2139
02:31:55,310 --> 02:31:57,350
Please send a kiss to your dad...

2140
02:31:58,520 --> 02:31:59,900
my Ghetto Pat.

2141
02:32:01,230 --> 02:32:04,530
Love, your mom, Perfidia.

2142
02:32:32,720 --> 02:32:35,350
How do I get this flash to work?

2143
02:32:35,430 --> 02:32:37,560
It's not gettin' my face.

2144
02:32:37,640 --> 02:32:39,100
Huh?

2145
02:32:39,190 --> 02:32:41,480
I don't know how to get it... to get my face.

2146
02:32:41,570 --> 02:32:44,570
Swipe up, and then there's a lightning bolt.

2147
02:32:44,650 --> 02:32:47,950
And then on there, it says, "Flash auto on and off."

2148
02:32:48,030 --> 02:32:48,910
No.

2149
02:32:48,990 --> 02:32:50,950
Well, if you push the...

2150
02:32:51,030 --> 02:32:52,870
There's a little...

2151
02:32:52,950 --> 02:32:55,080
There's a little circle on the bottom right side.

2152
02:32:55,160 --> 02:32:56,500
Click that.

2153
02:32:56,580 --> 02:32:58,420
Okay. Or take it with the back.

2154
02:32:58,500 --> 02:32:59,830
I guess that's fine.

2155
02:32:59,920 --> 02:33:01,630
- QST, QST. - I gotta press the circle.

2156
02:33:01,710 --> 02:33:04,670

2159
02:33:09,260 --> 02:33:10,890
Yeah.

2160
02:33:10,970 --> 02:33:13,890

2161
02:33:13,970 --> 02:33:16,850

All hands on deck. N6EDG.

2164
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:25,690
You know, Oakland's a three-and-a-half-hour drive from here.

2165
02:33:25,780 --> 02:33:26,780
Yeah.

2166
02:33:26,860 --> 02:33:28,650

2167
