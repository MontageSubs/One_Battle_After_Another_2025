00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,480
那一套白人中产
A White-bred,

283
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,270
市侩庸俗 恶心透顶的公司文化
philistine, asshole corporate culture,

284
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,730
它唯一的目的
whose only end

285
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,530
就是打更多广告 捞更多钱
is to perfect the science of advertising.

286
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,610
我跟你说实话
But I ain't gonna hold ya, bitch.

287
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,910
他要是敢对我不好
If he treats me different after I drop

288
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,370
等这个小东西从我肚子里爬出来

289

我可不忍着 你看我宰了他

290

宝贝 别这样
Bae, stop.

291
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,810
看我敢不敢
I'll kill him dead!

292
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,470
趁他还没打倒我
Before he beats me!

293
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,130
说什么呢 姐们儿？
What the fuck? That...

294
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,300
她好像不知道自己怀孕了一样
It's like she doesn't even realize she's pregnant.

295
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,800
那就是孩子爸爸 长得跟其他白巧克力一样

{\an8}【白巧克力爹：俚语 黑人妻子讥讽性称呼白人丈夫】

297

You right.

298
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,520
你知道我的意思吧？
You feel me? No...

299
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,370
就是这样 拿起一个 放下去
Okay, so put one up and down.

对 这就是说 我是庄家
Okay, so that means...I'm the house.

302
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,510
你和我女儿一点都不般配
You know, you are so unsuitable for my daughter.

303
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,720
我？
Me?

304
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,880
对 你
Yeah, you.

305

真可笑
And that's hilarious.

306

我女儿来自的家族 几代人都是革命者
My child comes from a whole line of revolutionaries.

308
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,000
而你一脸茫然
And you look so lost.

309
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,600
她大步向前 你却沉溺当下
She's a runner, and you a stump.

310
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,390
这孩子你打算怎么办？
What are you gonna do about this baby? Hm?

311
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,010
我只是想被人看见 还有
No, I just, I wanna feel seen and...

312
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,310
被人爱 被欣赏
loved and appreciated.

313
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,390
我怀孩子整整九个月
I fuckin' carried her nine months.

314
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,780
现在他却整天只知道围着宝宝转
And now he can just, gets to fuckin' walk around...

315
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,750
看见孩子就开心得不得了
and just swoonin' all fuckin' day.

316
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,660
就好像 他只爱女儿一个人
It's like she's his only girl.

317
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,200
我就是空气 是一块肉
Like, I just no longer exist. I'm just a fuckin' piece of meat.

318
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,870
有时候我觉得自己疯了
And sometimes, I feel crazy,

319
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,710
我居然会嫉妒自己的宝宝 这正常吗？
'cause I'm just like...am I weird for being jealous of my baby?

320
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,960
我感觉没人关心我 没人爱我
I don't fuckin' feel seen. I don't feel love.

321
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,260
我肯定变丑了
I feel fuckin' ugly.

322
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,620
我的胸口疼 我几乎都没有奶水了
My nipples hurt. I can barely fucking produce milk.

323
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,950
我…
You know, I...

324
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,380
我感觉糟透了
I'm not okay.

325
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,440
亲爱的 你大晚上去哪儿？
Baby, where do you think you're goin', huh?

326
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,080
穿成这样上哪儿去？
Where you goin' like that?

327
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,160
别跟我说话 我想去哪儿就去哪儿
Stop talkin' to me. I go as I please.

328
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,180
你看我们都成家了
You realize that we're a family now, right?

329
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,710
用不着闹革命了
You don't have to do this anymore.

330
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,670
你知道我说过 我为自己而活
You realize I put myself first, right?

331
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,430
你就是害怕这一点
And that's what you scared of.

332
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,060
我们都有孩子了 总不会忘了吧？
We have her now. You do get that, right?

333
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,030
首先 我为自己活 其次 你的话老掉牙了
I put myself first, and I reject your lack of originality.

334
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,510
天啊 说我老掉牙
God, my lack of originality.

335
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,900
请你不要再胡扯了好吗？
Will you stop with all this bullshit?

336
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,890
别再闹了 你和我成家了
Would you stop it? We're a goddamn family.

337
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,180
你有责任照顾孩子
You have her to take care of.

338
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,430
你以为你还能去哪儿？
Where the hell do you think you're goin'?

339
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,370
好啦 宝宝
It's okay, baby.

340
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,780
没事的 不哭了
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

341

宝宝不哭 没事的
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

342
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,750
不要给我灌输你的想法
This is a new consciousness.

343
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,140
我的想法？
New consciousness?

344

我也不是你妈
I'm not your mother.

347
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,180
你想要掌控我
You want your power over me,

348
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,520
就像你们男人总想掌控一切
The same reason you want your power over the world.

349

你和你那玻璃心的大男子主义
You and your crumblin' male ego...

350

永远不会成为这场革命的战友
Will never do this revolution like me.

351
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,050
所以请滚出我的房子
Fuck outta here.

看得出来
You can tell that she actually

她是真心想做一个好学生

你还好吗？
Are you okay?

566
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,400
我这眼泪只是...
If I get emotional, it's just um...

567
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,220
喜极而泣
Tears of joy, that's all.

571
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:51,170
说实话 薇拉一直没有妈妈
You know, Willa grew up without her mom.

572
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,200
她妈妈在她很小的时候死了
Her mom died when she was very young.

573
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,220
是这样啊
Oh. I see.

574
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,580
薇拉从没见过妈妈？
So Willa never knew her mother?

575
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,650
没有 从来没见过
No. She never did.

谢谢您 先生
Thank you very much, sir.

617
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,990
移民就像汹涌的潮水
Each and every day is hand-to-hand combat

618
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,290
每天都是一场硬仗 对吗？
in the spread of uncontrolled migration, isn't it?

619
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,330
您说得没错
Yes, it is, sir.

620
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,200
是啊
Yeah.

621
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:51,760
有人说“解决移民 拯救地球”
Well, "You wanna save the planet, you start with immigration."

622
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,730
完全正确 先生
That's exactly right, sir.

623
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,610
这是你说的
You said that.

624
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,530
几年前卧石行动结束后说的
A few years back, after Squatting Pebble.

625

我听说你对我们感兴趣

627
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,710
你是不是很荣幸
And does it honor you

628
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,590
能被提名加入我们的俱乐部？

630
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,590
当然是这样
Yes, it is.

631
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,570
史蒂文 我们在过去几年呢
Steve, we have, in the past,

632
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,990
招募了一些军方成员加入俱乐部
Offered membership to certain members of the military.

633
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,720
我们发现他们的
We found their...

634
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,740
实战经验和专业战术相当有用
Tactical battlefield expertise to be quite useful.

635
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,350
你看 我们和你的目标是一致的
Now, our aim and your aim is the same.

636
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,330
及时发现危险的疯子 恨国者
To find dangerous lunatics, haters

637
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,570
地痞流氓 及时制止
And punk trash and stop them.

638
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:42,420
再也不会有人闹事
No more lunatics.

639
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,520
我不知道你有没有听说
Now, I'm not sure if you've heard or not,

640
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,800
吉姆·克林格去世了
but Jim Kringle passed away.

641
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:50,190
{\an8}【克林格：意为耶稣小孩 为英语中圣诞老人的别称】

642
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,060
我听到了消息
Oh, I did hear that, yes.

643
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,830
俱乐部有空缺了
This means an opening.

644
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:57,230
上校 我可以毫不夸张地说
Colonel, I don't think I'm being immodest when I say

645
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,920
如果能够加入圣诞先驱俱乐部
that joining the Christmas Adventurers Club

646
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,910
你就正式成为了高尚的人
means that you are a superior man.

647
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,890
你不是最优秀 最聪明的人
No, not the best man, not the most intelligent,

648
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,020
也不是最见多识广和智慧的人
The most sophisticated, or the wisest.

649
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,850
你只是比其他人更优越 更高尚
It just means that you are superior to other human beings,

650
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:18,570
当然你会得到财富 交到最好的朋友
And you shall never want for riches or the greatest of friends.

651
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:23,180
我们是独立运作 行事也可以机动灵活
Now, we report to ourselves with a freedom to be creative

652
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,700
省略一些繁琐的程序
and cut through layers of bureaucracy.

653
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,890
我们信奉金科玉律
We live by the Golden Rule,

654
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:30,810
目标是与志同道合的伙伴们一起

655
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:34,180
让世界变得更安全 更纯净
dedicated to makin' the world safe and pure.

656
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,190
如果有人认为
What would you say to someone who believes

657
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,820
你在种族净化行动中
that you have been soft

658
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,190
表现出软弱动摇 你会怎么说？
in your duty to racial purification?

659
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,810
我会说
I would say

660
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,600
说这样话的人不配活在社会上
they are a liar who has no business in society.

661
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,350
也不配活在地球上
Or on the planet, for that matter. Mm.

662
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,250
你现在有配偶吗？
Do you presently live with a spouse?

663
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,410
没有
No, sir.

664
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,760
你有没有因为心理健康问题 咨询过医生？
Have you ever consulted with a mental health professional?

665
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,460
没有
No, sir.

666
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,030
你有没有拖欠债务
Have you ever had any bills or debts

667
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,340
被人追债？
turned over to a collection agency?

668
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,640
我买过一辆水上摩托
Well, I did purchase a jet ski.

669
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,850
是悄羽蜂速238那个型号的升级款
It was an evolution of the old Hummingbird Whisperdoo 238.

670
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:11,310
叫做疾爆海豚335
Called the Dynamite Dolphin 335.

671
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,270
它性能有缺陷
It was defective.

672
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,110
我就拒绝了付款 但我一点也不后悔
I abstained from payment. I'd do it again. I have no regrets.

673
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,000
好的
Okay.

674
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,330
你有没有公开参与过
Have you ever knowingly engaged

675
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,850
任何针对美国的恐怖活动？
in any acts of terrorism against this country?

676
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,280
没有
No, sir.

677
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:30,020
你有没有经历过跨种族的恋爱关系？
Have you ever engaged in an interracial relationship?

678
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:30,900
没有
No, sir.

679
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,670
你是美国出生的非犹太人？
And you are American-born by gentile?

680
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:35,520
是的
Yes, sir.

681
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,260
有一点我要说清楚
Now, to avoid any misunderstanding,

682
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,130
你申请加入俱乐部期间
we require absolute secrecy

683
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,090
必须对此事完全保密
through the initiation process

684
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,720
这是为了测试你的无私和忠诚
to judge how serious and unselfish you are.

685
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,430
- 明白吗？ - 嗯
- You understand? - Mm-hmm.

686
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,090
另外 想要成为候选成员
And to be considered to a vote,

687
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,740
你必须自愿接受一项背景审查

688
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,340
用来查明你个人可能有的任何问题
This identifies anything problematic in your character.

689
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,440
我能有什么问题吗？
What could be a problem?

690
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,500
我不知道
I don't know.

691
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,230
你有问题吗？
What could be a problem?

692
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,980
绝对不会有
Absolutely nothing.

693
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,060
我们需要了解你是否可靠
We wanna know who we're standing with.

694
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,870
当然

695
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,370
审查是由
Now,

Our main target tonight is Rimhorn's Chicken Lickin' Frozen Food Farm.

840
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:09,140
情报显示 香香鸡厂只是幌子
HUMINT reporting has led us to believe Chicken Lickin' is a front

841
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,010
实际上 它是这一带的 大规模海洛因分销点
for a large-scale heroin distribution operation within the AO.

842
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:15,780

of Chicken Lickin' Frozen Food Farm in order to destroy

844
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:22,610
以捣毁该区域内的海洛因分销窝点
heroin distribution operations within the AO.

845
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:24,650
同时当地警方也会行动
Simultaneously, local law enforcement,

846
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:27,820
你们负责搜查并控制布拉茨基轮胎行
You will clear and secure Blatski's Tires,

847
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,750

Tiburón's Taco Shack in the Baktan Mall,

849
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:35,960
还有杰及工业大街上的加油站
and the gas station on J and Boiler Street.

850
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,620
这是个庇护城市
This is a sanctuary city

851
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,540
有几千拉丁裔
for thousands of wet bodies.

852
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,000
当地的居民很可能
Expect the local populace to be

853
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,180
会同情 甚至包庇
sympathetic and supportive

854
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,600
我们今晚要突击的犯罪组织
to the criminal organizations we are targeting tonight, gentlemen.

855
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,510
多谢
Thank you.

856
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,780
你还没醒酒
You're hungover,

857
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:06,910
凌晨三点才回家
and you got home at 3:00 in the morning.

858
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,210
你去哪儿了？
Where were you?

859
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:09,400
去哪儿？
Where, what?

860
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:10,700
宝贝 你也不帮我热一下
This isn't even warm, sweetie.

861
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,230
你去哪儿了？
Where were you?

862
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:13,040
我去哪儿？
Where was I?

863
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,410
我去了 我...
I was...

864
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:17,370
我特地告诉过你我去了哪儿
Well, I specifically told you where I was.

865
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,120
你问过我 我也回答了你
You asked me that. I told you where I was.

866
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,380
我去了乡土酒馆 听乐队演奏
I was at the Rustic Inn with the old band.

867
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,490
是我们以前爱听的乐队 记得吗？
You remember our old band, right?

868
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,630
就是他们 正常街区外
The old band, sweetie. A Block Past Normal.

869
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,010
记得艾伯特吗？
You remember Albert?

870
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:30,910
记得
Yeah.

871
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,100
我才知道
Turns out,

872
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,260
艾伯特买了一些旧设备
Albert bought all this old equipment

873
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,060
都是史提利·丹乐队的录音室用过的
from Steely Dan's old studio

874
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,770
{\an8}【史提利·丹乐队：1970年代美国摇滚与爵士融合乐队】

875
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,810
他买下这些就是为了玩复古
to try to get that sort of vintage, you know,

876
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,310
追求所谓的真空管音色
that sort of crackling tube sound.

877
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,980
现在谁要听这种东西？
You don't need any of that stuff anymore.

878
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,900
他还买了个电脑软件
He brought out a computer program.

879
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,860
说是只要按一下按钮
Boom, with the press of a button--

880
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,840
你怎么回家的？
How'd you get home?

881
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,270
什么意思？
What do you mean?

882
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:52,300
你怎么回家的？
How did you get home?

883
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,030
我开车回来的
Well, with my car.

884
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,400
醉驾了？
You drove?

885
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,120
怎么？难道你是我的保姆吗？
So what are you, my babysitter? What, what, what...

886
00:52:59,140 --> 00:52:59,710
对啊
Yeah.

887
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:02,790
我会喝酒 也会开车 我能照顾好自己
I know how to drink and drive, honey. I know what I'm doin'.

888
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,380
- 我也没喝那么多 - 爸爸
- I didn't have that much. - Dad.

889
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,640
什么？
What?

890
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,000
干吗？
What?

891
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:08,170
说呀
What?

892
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:09,380
我也不想当你的保姆
I don't wanna be your babysitter.

893
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,660
我不想天天操心你有没有
I don't wanna worry if you wrapped

894
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,930
把车撞到电线杆子上
your cararound a telephone pole.

895
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:12,640
我没有撞到电线...
Well, I didn't wrap my--

896
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,800
我不是这个意思
I didn't ask for this.

897
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,430
可我怎么躺上这种事情？
That's just how the cards were rolled out for me.

898
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:16,290
不对
It's...

899
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:18,810
是摊上
It's "dice," sweetie.

900
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:19,480
什么？
What?

901
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,100
不是躺上这种事 是摊上这种事
It's not "cards." You don't roll cards. It's dice.

902
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:22,940
滚一边去 鲍勃
Fuck off, Bob.

903
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,360
别再扯这些了 好吗？
Just fuck off with that, okay?

904
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,580
成熟点儿
Grow up.

905
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,970
好吧
Wow. Okay.

906
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,160
我想说 你能表达自己的观点
Well, you... Look. I like the way you're standin' up for yourself.

907
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,950
这样非常好
I'm proud of ya, honey,

908
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:35,410
但是有时候
but the way you, uh,

909
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:38,160
你对你爸说话的方式有点...
Speak to your father sometimes, it's just...

910
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:40,290
你说得也对
I don't know. You're right.

911
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:42,580
以后多跟我坦诚相待
You should tell me what you think, always.

912
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,080
任何事情都不要瞒我
Never hold anything back from me.

913
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,050
你到底是有什么毛病？
What the fuck is wrong with you?

914
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:48,630
说得对 我得记住 我这人有毛病
You're right. That's somethin' I gotta remember.

915
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,670
时不时还会搞砸事情
And I fuck up sometimes.

916
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,800
谁来了？
Whoa. Who's this?

917
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,070
那是谁？
Who's that?

918
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:58,180
是什么人？
Who is that?

919
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,570
只是我的朋友
They're just my friends.

920
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,350
朋友？
And they just,

921
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:03,650
还开个红色的车
They have a red car like that, just drivin'...

922
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:04,940
太张扬了吧？
Little loud, don't you think?

923
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,980
一辆车而已
It's just a car.

924
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,940
- 是你让他们开过来的？ - 对
- And you told 'em they could do that? - Yes.

925
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,940
到我们家门口？
Told 'em to come to the house?

926
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,670
怎么了
Yes!

927
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:11,390
那个涂口红的是谁？
Now, who's the one with the lipstick?

928
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:13,330
叫什么名字？
What's that one's name?

929
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:14,110
波波
Bobo.

930
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:16,520
波波 这是男的？女的？还是别的什么性别？
Bobo. Now, is that a he or a she or a they?

931
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,490
行了 老爸
Dad, come on.

932
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:19,240
我只是想知道 这位是在性别过渡还是…
No, are they transitioning? I wanna know if...

933
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,290
人家是是非二元性别
They're nonbinary.

934
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:24,960
{\an8}【非二元性别：不完全认同传统男女二元分类的性别身份】

935
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,040
好吧 我只是想确定一下称呼
Okay, I just wanna be polite. All right.

936
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,960
没什么好确定的 用中性词
It's not that hard! "They, them."

937
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,380
门口那个臭小子又是谁？
And who's this little fuckin' freak at the door?

938
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,340
大概是布罗托
Probably Bluto.

939
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,670
就这样登门的？
They're just comin' to my house like this, huh?

940
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:29,420
怎么了？
Yes!

941
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,050
没事
All right.

942
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,720
这小子是不是你的舞伴？
Is that your date to the dance?

943
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,200
- 是我朋友 - 好吧
- My friend. - Okay.

944
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,930
你哪儿也不许去
You're not goin' anywhere with your goddamn friend

945
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,600
除非拿上这个
until you take it.

946
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:37,710
快拿上
Take it!

对 放在口袋里
Yep. Put it in your pocket.

949
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:45,980
我不想放在口袋里
I don't wanna put it in my pocket.

950
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,690
那就放在吊袜带里面好了
Put it in your garter or whatever you got.

951
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:48,940
谁还穿吊袜带？
My fucking garter?

952
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,230
什么？你这...
What? Mother...

对 对
Yeah, yeah.

958
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:57,370
你平时敲别人家门都是这么大声吗？
You normally knock that loud at somebody's house like that?

959
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,270
- 是 - 耐心等着
- Uh, yeah. - Yeah, give us a sec, homie.

960
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,450
可以放在...你带包吗？
Put it in... You got a purse?

961
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,080
你必须拿上它
This is non-negotiable!

962
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,000
放在你包里
Put it in your purse!

963
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,460
没人会来抓你的 鲍勃
Nobody's coming to get you, Bob.

964
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,340
你自己也知道
You know that, right?

965
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,220
那是你以为
That's what you think.

966
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,170
你们好吗？
What's up, guys?

967

969
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,640
要去舞会吗？
Goin' to the dance?

970
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:15,920
好 没问题
Yeah, it's cool.

971
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,010
听着 记住
Listen, I'm gonna tell you somethin',

972
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:18,760
如果你敢伤害薇拉
whatever you do to her,

973
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,180
我就会对你以牙还牙
I'm gonna do that exact same thing

还会报复你们全家
to your entire fuckin' family.

975
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,670
我说真的

1558
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:39,620
我懂你的意思 但你要告诉我
I understand. And the question is...

1559
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,910
- 去死吧 - “那现在是几点？”
- Fuck! - ..."What time is it?"

1560
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,500
你要是不告诉我集合地点

你就等着瞧吧 我一定会揪出你

不
No.

好好休息吧 大小姐
Make yourself at home, Goldilocks.

1863
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:23,270
她知道多少？
What does she know?

1864
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:27,310
她以为她母亲是英雄
She thinks her mom was a hero.

1865
01:33:28,610 --> 01:33:29,660
我有点儿...

1866
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,490
不忍心告诉她真相
I didn't have the guts to tell her the truth.

1867
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:37,870

1943
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,790
是黑的
It's Black.

1944
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:34,230
天啊
Well, uh...

1945
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:38,110
这件事如果是真的
That would be quite the revelation

1946
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:39,430
那就太可怕了
if it were true.

1947
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:44,430
比尔 请问这消息哪儿来的？
Bill, may I ask what your source is?

1948
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:48,270
来自纯血美国白人背景审查报告
Sure. That's part of a Double Yankee White background check.

1949
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:50,810
我们在电脑里找到了一些旧文件
Some old paperwork turned up in a computer file

1950
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:54,300
是关于一个叫贱女姜戈的黑人罪犯
on the Black militant named Junglepussy.

1951
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:58,960
15年前 她就跟一个警官讲过这件事
She told an officer this very story 15 years ago.

1952
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:01,210
15年前啊
Fifteen years ago.

1953
01:38:01,570 --> 01:38:05,670
那些文件一直都在 我们能翻出来纯属走运
It's been there the whole time, in ancient file. Pure luck we caught it.

1954
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:08,710
这个贱女在哪儿？
So where's the Pussy?

1955
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:10,130
她早就死了
Oh, she's long dead.

1956
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,320
哦 贱命一条
Oh. No more Pussy.

1957
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:13,920
总之 几天前
Now, a few days ago,

1958
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:15,960
勒喉乔雇佣赏金猎人
Lockjaw hired a bounty hunter

1959
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:18,860
在埃尔帕索抓走了一个平民
to make a civilian extraction in El Paso.

1960
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:22,350
带队的是阿威腾·魁 你认识吗？
It was led by an Avanti Q. You know him?

1961
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:24,720
认识 阿威腾是个好军人
Yeah, I know Avanti. He's a good soldier.

1962
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:25,970
有多好？
Not great?

1963
01:38:26,230 --> 01:38:28,730
很不错 可惜他不是白人
I mean, he's excellent, but he's not a native son.

1964
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,150
这是他的肮脏小秘密
That's his dirty little secret.

1965
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:35,400
他假装是半个墨西哥人 其实有印第安血统
He passes for half-Mexican, but he's actually part Comanche

1966
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:36,390
还是爱斯基摩人血统
or, I don't know, Eskimo.

1967
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:38,620
他很擅长追踪
He's a fantastic tracker.

1968
01:38:39,070 --> 01:38:42,030
光看脚印 他就知道对方口袋里有多少钱
He'll tell you how much money someone had in their pocket based on a footprint,

1969
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:45,110
但他不是白人 所以不可信
but he is not homegrown, so I would not trust it.

1970
01:38:45,130 --> 01:38:47,890
不过 显然他有足够的本事
Yeah, well, he's apparently good enough

1971
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:49,960
找到勒喉乔一直想找的人
to find what Lockjaw was lookin' for.

1972
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:54,110
没错 他找到了霍华德·萨默威尔
Yeah. He found Howard Sommerville.

1973
01:38:55,230 --> 01:38:59,010
前法式七五成员 现在运营一个地下组织
Ex-French 75. He runs an underground railroad,

1974
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:01,550
将非法移民从南方边境
bringing illegals from our southern border

1975
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:03,220
带去北方的归援十字市
to Baktan Cross in the north,

1976
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:06,060
把那儿变成了庇护城市
where he set up a so-called sanctuary city,

1977
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:09,400
帮助毒贩和神经病在美国扎根
giving jobs and housing to drug dealers and psychopaths.

1978
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:12,100
他还是一个瘾君子
He's also a reefer addict.

1979
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,870
真的？这么说他还挺有能耐的
Really? Well, he sounds like a class act, this guy.

1980
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:16,040
抓走他之后
Next thing we know,

1981
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:19,780
勒喉乔上校的特遣队 进入了归援十字市
Colonel Lockjaw's mobilized his task force into Baktan Cross

1982
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,070
对香香鸡速冻食品厂
and conducted a Class-A raid

1983
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:24,560
进行了最高等级突袭
on the Chicken Lickin' Frozen Farm.

1984
01:39:24,950 --> 01:39:27,880
哦不 我很喜欢他们家的鸡块
Oh, no. I love their nuggets.

1985
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:31,070
是吗？暂时可能买不到了
Well, this could mean a nugget shortage.

1986
01:39:31,850 --> 01:39:35,220
更何况 厂长也是我们俱乐部的成员
Not to mention the Chicken Lickin's owned by our fellow Christmas Adventurer,

1987
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:39,810
他希望那些拉丁狗非法劳工 能快点复工
Brother Burt Rimhorn, who wants his wetbacks back to work.

1988
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:40,800
接着说
Next...

1989
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:42,720
他还搜查了高中 提姆
He hit the high school, Tim.

1990
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:43,600
没错
Yeah.

1991
01:39:44,030 --> 01:39:45,660
是那所高中
The high school.

1992
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:50,180
现在归援十字市已经乱成一锅粥了
And now, all hell's broken loose on the streets of Baktan Cross.

1993
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,230
他还关闭了实时共享
And he's turned off his A-TAK's.

1994
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:53,150
抱歉 我插一下嘴
I'm sorry to interrupt,

1995
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:55,690
我听明白你们想说什么了
But I think I'm pickin' up what you gents are layin' down here.

1996
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:57,540
这些事儿确实不寻常
This is a curious chain of events.

1997
01:39:58,630 --> 01:40:01,470
勒喉乔在找自己的杂种私生子
So Lockjaw's lookin' for his half-breed,

1998
01:40:01,490 --> 01:40:04,040
但护崽的妈妈在哪里？
but do we know where the mama bear is?

1999
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:05,610
这事情可有意思了
Funny you should ask that.

2000
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:10,430
母亲叛娅·富山
Perfidia Beverly Hills.

2001
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:14,120
目前下落不明 前法式七五成员
Currently M.I.A. Former French 75.

2002
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:17,460
15年前做了污点证人
She went into witness protection about 15 years ago,

2003
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:19,530
后来就消失了
only to disappear.

2004
01:40:19,650 --> 01:40:21,280
逮捕她的警官
The arresting agent...

2005
01:40:21,910 --> 01:40:24,000
正是史蒂文·勒喉乔上校
Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw.

2006
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:27,660
有些报告说她在古巴
Agency sightings have her in Cuba or Algiers,

2007
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:29,430
也有人说她在阿尔及尔
depending on the report.

2008
01:40:29,450 --> 01:40:34,270
看来 她没有母爱
So...not the mothering type, I take it.

2009
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:38,710
他们还好意思说我们野蛮
And they call us the savages.

2010
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:42,490
勒喉乔把自己染脏了
Lockjaw got his dick dirty.

2011
01:40:44,410 --> 01:40:46,890
他正在清洗自己
He needs to clean it.

2012
01:40:48,350 --> 01:40:50,830
如果他能找到孩子
If he can find this kid,

2013
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:54,130
他就能消灭证据
He can dispose of the evidence,

2014
01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:58,250
继续把我们耍得团团转
And continue to make fools out of all of us.

2015
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:04,580
您希望我做什么？
What would you like me to do, sir?

2016
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:10,810
提姆 你很擅长解决家庭案件
Tim, given your expertise in family cases,

2017
01:41:10,830 --> 01:41:11,330
我们希望你...
we felt that maybe--

2018
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,340
处理干净
Make it clean.

2019
01:41:16,290 --> 01:41:17,500
干净？
Clean?

2020
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:22,400
要干净到地板都能当镜子
We should all be able to eat off the floor.

2021
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:25,820
对 要不留痕迹
Yeah. It's that clean.

2022
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:27,980
遵命
Yes, sir.

2023
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:34,160
好了 先生们 我该去西部了
Well, all right, gents. Looks like I'm headed west.

2024
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,880
愿圣尼古拉保佑你
And may Saint Nick be with you.

2025
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:40,370
向圣尼古拉敬礼
All hail Saint Nick.

2026
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,410
我能问你一件事吗？
I have something to ask you, okay?

2027
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:15,130
问吧
'Kay.

2028
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,570
她是叛徒吗？
Was she a rat?

2029
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:25,480
对 她是
Yeah, she was.

2030
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:30,900
我爸爸说她是个英雄
My dad told me she was a hero.

2031
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:34,840
不要撞脑袋 不要撞脑袋
Hey, stop banging your head. Stop banging your head.

2032
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:37,350
不要再撞脑袋了
Stop banging your head on that.

2033
01:42:37,370 --> 01:42:38,420
好吧
Okay.

2034
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:39,810
先生 你姓什么？
Sir, do you know your last name?

2035
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:40,970
不知道
No.

2036
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,700
你叫什么？
What's your last name?

2037
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:45,650
蝙蝠侠
Batman.

2038
01:42:45,670 --> 01:42:48,410

- 最好乖乖说实话 - 好好好
- it's gonna be another charge. What is it? - Okay, okay.

2044

42岁
Forty-two years old?

2058
01:43:26,830 --> 01:43:29,640
她要从身后测量你的生命体征

2059
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:31,260

你昨天打胰岛素了吗？
Did you take your insulin yesterday?

2070
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:58,560
你要是有糖尿病
You know, if you're a bad hombre,

2071
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:01,490
必须每天都打胰岛素 知道吗？
You make sure you take your insulin on a daily basis. Right?

2072
01:44:03,330 --> 01:44:06,770
警官 这里检查不了 他得去急救室
Officer, we're not gonna be able to take this one. He needs to go out to the ER.

帕克先生 这边是卫生间
Mr. Parker, here's your restroom, okay?

2077
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:19,870
来查查血糖

01:52:29,060 --> 01:52:31,830
我可以对天发誓 我不知道
I swear, I don't know. I don't know.

2215
01:52:31,860 --> 01:52:33,740
迪安德拉 这种话我听过太多次了
Deandra, you know how many people sit across

2216
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,940
耳朵都快起茧了
from me and swear to God...

2217
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:37,880
你们都爱说
They don't know?

2218
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:41,360
“我发誓我不知道”
"I swear to God, I don't know."

2219
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:46,240
我也发誓 如果你知道
I swear to God if you do know,

2220
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:48,380
就能救那个女孩
We can save that girl.

2221
01:52:48,610 --> 01:52:49,780
那女孩是无辜的
The girl didn't do anything, and I don't know.

2222
01:52:49,810 --> 01:52:52,480
我真不知道帕特在哪儿
I don't know where he is.

2223
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,950
我要是知道就说了
If I knew where he was, I would tell you.

2224
01:52:53,970 --> 01:52:54,930
但我真不知道
I don't know where he is.

2225
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:56,170
你怎么回事？
What the fuck's wrong with you?

2226
01:52:56,190 --> 01:52:57,310
告诉我帕特在哪儿
Where is he?

2227
01:52:57,330 --> 01:52:59,190
你就能活着去坐牢
Save yourself, go to prison,

2228
01:52:59,210 --> 01:53:00,800
我带着消息去找上校
I'll take it to the Colonel,

2229
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:02,570
那女孩就能得救
You save the girl.

2230
01:53:02,590 --> 01:53:04,910
棋局已定 你无路可选了
Those are your options. You're in a lose-lose,

2231
01:53:04,930 --> 01:53:07,510
就看你想不想保住小命了
maybe-save-your-life position.

2232
01:53:14,630 --> 01:53:18,030
你应该多化化妆 让自己好看点儿
You should put on more makeup to make yourself look better.

2233
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:22,430
舞会这样重要的场合
You go to a dance,

2234
01:53:22,450 --> 01:53:24,370
不能犯懒
you make an effort.

2235
01:53:24,390 --> 01:53:26,710
必须好好化妆
You put on more makeup.

2236
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:35,950
你的衬衫怎么那么紧？
Why is your shirt so tight?

2237
01:53:42,070 --> 01:53:44,390
你不要乱猜 我可不是基佬
I'm not gay, if that's what you're sayin'.

2238
01:53:44,410 --> 01:53:45,720
我可没这么说
I didn't say that.

2239
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:47,580
反正我不是同性恋
I'm not a homosexual.

2240
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:48,840
这是你提的
I did not say that,

2241
01:53:48,870 --> 01:53:51,240
但我确实发现你穿了增高鞋垫
But I see the lifts in your shoes.

2242
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:53,590
你以为自己很聪明吗？
Oh, you are a smartass.

2243
01:53:53,610 --> 01:53:55,370
真是太典型了
You... Oh, yeah, yeah.

2244
01:53:55,390 --> 01:53:58,680
你就是个娇生惯养的小公主
You just, you're just a little princess, aren't you?

2245
01:53:59,050 --> 01:54:01,570
就会耍嘴皮子
Smart mouth. Like your mother.

2246
01:54:01,590 --> 01:54:04,920
你妈嘴巴也很毒 最后还是被我征服了
Your mother had a smart mouth, and I buried her.

2247
01:54:12,570 --> 01:54:15,910
真聪明 又要看说明书 刚说过就忘了吗？
Are you having trouble remembering what you just read?

2248
01:54:15,930 --> 01:54:17,510
如果连成横线 我就有麻烦了
If it's a straight line, I have a problem.

2249
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:19,180
如果不是 就放我走
If it's not, you have to let me go.

2250
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:20,300
你不可能是我爸爸
God, there's no way I'm actually yours,

2251
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:21,860
因为我没这么笨
'cause I can actually fucking read.

2252
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:24,100
够了 闭上你的臭嘴
You shut up. Just shut up!

2253
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:27,050
你就是个小杂种
You fucking mutt!

2254
01:54:45,490 --> 01:54:46,870
坏了
Uh-oh.

2255
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:10,010
把我车开来 箱子放上面
Get my vehicle. Put my kid in the car.

2256
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:19,220
我从没想过这混蛋还会回来抓我们
Just never thought this fucker would come back for us, you know?

2257
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:24,400
是我大意了 没有好好防范
I got lazy, man. I wasn't payin' attention.

2258
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:31,150
我没想过这混蛋会回来
I thought the person comin' through that door one day

2259
01:55:31,170 --> 01:55:34,030
倒是想过她妈叛娅可能会回来
was gonna be her mom, not this fuckin' asshole.

2260
01:55:36,270 --> 01:55:41,050
我以为她会回来看女儿 教她一些女孩的事儿
See her daughter, you know, she'd teach her girl stuff,

2261
01:55:41,070 --> 01:55:43,540
给她扎个头发
She'd do her hair, she'd...

2262
01:55:45,190 --> 01:55:47,020
做回妈妈
Be a mom.

2263
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:54,660
我不懂怎么帮她扎头发
I can't do her hair, man.

2264
01:55:54,860 --> 01:55:56,260
你知道吗？
You know that?

2265
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:00,120
我怎么也扎不好
I don't know how to do her hair right.

2266
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:00,970
是吗？
Well...

2267
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:09,110
别太伤感了 鲍勃
Don't go dark on me, Bob.

2268
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:14,380
好吧
I won't.

2269
01:56:15,730 --> 01:56:17,490
好了 没事了
I'm here. I'm here.

2270
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,320
把酒收起来 兄弟
Bring it down, bro.

把这藏你包里
Put this in your backpack.

2275
01:56:47,010 --> 01:56:49,000
看来咱们完蛋了 是吧？
Guess this is the end of the line, huh?

2276
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:52,170
你还没完
Not for you.

2277
01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:56,510
心如止水 平静 平静
Ocean waves. Ocean waves.

2278
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,840
我得让你下车了 好兄弟
I gotta ditch you, Kemosabe.

2279
01:57:01,860 --> 01:57:03,630
- 什么？ - 你必须走过去
- What? - You gotta hit it on foot.

2280
01:57:03,650 --> 01:57:04,490
走过去？
On foot?

2281
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:05,360
对
Yeah.

2282
01:57:06,710 --> 01:57:08,100
听我说
Here we go.

2283
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:10,430
我会在前面加油站转弯
I'm gonna turn at this gas station,

2284
01:57:10,450 --> 01:57:12,270
然后降低车速
I'm gonna slow down,

2285
01:57:12,290 --> 01:57:13,470
你跳下车
and you tuck and roll.

2286
01:57:13,490 --> 01:57:14,710
剩下交给我
I'll take it from there.

想让我陪你玩游戏
Little daddy-daughter games?

说不上很理想
Things could be better.

2337

麻烦一桩接一桩
It's not one thing, it's a-fuckin'-nother.

2338
02:03:22,860 --> 02:03:24,330
能理解这种感觉吗？
Do you find that to be true?

2339

总之

02:23:58,220 --> 02:23:59,120
噢
Yeah.

2498
02:24:01,190 --> 02:24:02,720
勒喉乔上校
Colonel Lockjaw...

2499
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:07,940
你是不是和她 有过不正当的男女关系？
did you engage in a romantic relationship with this woman?

2500
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:11,210
{\an7}♪ （西班牙语）可是你

2501
02:24:11,540 --> 02:24:14,000
{\an7}♪ （西班牙语）谁知道你身在何处

2502
02:24:14,140 --> 02:24:15,480
先生们
Gentlemen...

2503
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:20,190
我曾在战场上与敌人正面厮杀
I have engaged the enemy face-to-face in battle.

2504
02:24:20,210 --> 02:24:25,420
也曾在阴暗角落跟间谍斗智斗勇
And in the dark alleys and shadows of espionage.

2505
02:24:27,470 --> 02:24:29,760
我曾经被
I was once...

2506
02:24:29,780 --> 02:24:32,410
逆向强奸过
raped in reverse.

2507
02:24:34,790 --> 02:24:36,720
逆向强奸？
Raped in reverse?

2508
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:40,720
能请你解释一下
Could you explain how that might...

2509
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:42,690
那是什么意思吗？
work for us, Colonel Lockjaw?

2510
02:24:42,710 --> 02:24:46,190
我不小心被敌军骗了 被下了药
The enemy employed deception. I was drugged.

2511
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:49,350
我失去了意识
And while unconscious...

2512
02:24:50,670 --> 02:24:52,630
大脑无法正常工作
My brain was not working.

2513
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:58,220
但我的雄风仍在 所以被敌军占了便宜
But my power was, and I believe it was taken advantage of.

2514
02:24:59,890 --> 02:25:01,430
你有证据吗？
What kind of proof do you have?

2515
02:25:01,450 --> 02:25:03,650
如果没有意识 你怎么知道的？
If you were unconscious, how do you know this to be true?

2516
02:25:03,670 --> 02:25:05,770
我是推测出来的
I don't know it to be true, but I suspect it.

2517
02:25:05,790 --> 02:25:08,610
我醒来后 觉得那里有点儿不舒服
When I awoke, there was sensitivity in a private place,

2518
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:11,620
还发现了那种事的痕迹
and there was some residue of an interaction.

2519
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:14,480
那种事？
Interaction?

2520
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:17,570
她偷了我的生命之源
I believe she was a sperm thief.

2521
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:20,950
偷精生子
A semen demon.

2522
02:25:20,970 --> 02:25:22,080
没错
That's correct.

2523
02:25:22,110 --> 02:25:23,440
勒喉乔上校
Colonel Lockjaw,

2524
02:25:24,290 --> 02:25:27,830
敌军为什么要大费周章逆向强奸 怀你的孩子？
What would be the purpose of the enemy raping you in reverse?

2525
02:25:29,970 --> 02:25:33,190
我的心智与体魄充满了威能
They saw the power of my mind and body.

2526
02:25:33,590 --> 02:25:35,560
他们馋得不行
They desired it.

2527
02:25:45,630 --> 02:25:47,640
祝贺你 史蒂文
Congratulations, Steve.

2528
02:25:49,450 --> 02:25:51,720
你成功加入了圣诞先驱俱乐部
You're a Christmas Adventurer.

2529
02:25:51,740 --> 02:25:54,720
妈呀 谢谢您 先生
Oh, Mommy. Thank you, sir.

2530
02:25:55,190 --> 02:25:57,450
我带你参观一下西南总部
Let me show you around southwest headquarters.

2531
02:25:57,470 --> 02:25:58,010
好啊
Sure.

2532
02:25:58,040 --> 02:25:58,870
我们走吧
Should we go for a walk?

2533
02:25:58,890 --> 02:25:59,920
好的
Yes, sir.

2534
02:25:59,940 --> 02:26:01,480
参观第一站
First stop on the tour,

2535
02:26:01,790 --> 02:26:02,910
你的新办公室
your new office.

2536
02:26:02,940 --> 02:26:04,080
天啊
Oh, my.

2537
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:08,240
说实话 桑迪先生
You know, if I'm being honest, Sandy,

2538
02:26:08,260 --> 02:26:10,870
有那么一刻 我还以为自己失败了
there was a minute there where I didn't think I was gonna make it.

2539
02:26:10,890 --> 02:26:13,240
勒喉乔 有你加入是我们的幸事
Lockjaw, we're lucky to have you.

2540
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:15,400
好了 如你所见 大家都不在
Now, obviously, goes without saying,

2541
02:26:15,420 --> 02:26:18,310
这个办公室只是给你挂挂帽子
this is just one place where you can hang your hat,

2542
02:26:18,330 --> 02:26:21,200
开开会 放放个人物品的地方
take meetings, stow a few personal items.

2543
02:26:21,220 --> 02:26:24,340
我们希望每个成员都在总部有个家
We like our members to feel they have a home away from home,

2544
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:25,560
随时都可以回来
any time, day or night.

2545
02:26:25,580 --> 02:26:27,230
这个理念太棒了
That's a fine idea.

2546
02:26:27,250 --> 02:26:28,820
办公室现在还空着
Now, it's empty right now,

2547
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:30,700
但你可以自己布置
But we'll let you personalize it.

2548
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:32,740
一个人的品味是最重要的
A man's taste defines him, doesn't it?

2549
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:34,160
您说得太对了
It does indeed, sir.

2550
02:26:34,180 --> 02:26:36,330
好的 我们到了
And here we are.

Look at that view.

2553
02:26:44,620 --> 02:26:46,130
真是太美了
Would you look at that?

2554
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:48,210
我能进吗？
May I?

2555
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:49,280
当然可以
Absolutely.

2556
02:26:57,310 --> 02:26:59,690
糟糕 忘了拿你的钥匙
Damn it. I forgot your keys.

2557
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:01,320
在这儿等着 我这就回办公室拿
Wait here, I'll just grab 'em from my office.

2558
02:27:01,340 --> 02:27:02,650
遵命
Yes, sir.

2559
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:15,670
有一样东西 在我这儿保管很久了
I've been holding on to something for a while now

2560
02:28:15,690 --> 02:28:18,360
现在我想把它给你
and I wanted to give it to you.

2561
02:28:18,730 --> 02:28:19,890
好吗？
Okay?

2562
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:24,350
之前没有给你是因为...
And I didn't give it to you before because I...

2563
02:28:25,150 --> 02:28:28,920
我不想让你过早地接触这些事情
I just didn't wanna expose you to certain stuff.

2564
02:28:28,940 --> 02:28:31,000
说实话我不想让你...
You know, I didn't want you to feel...

2565
02:28:31,850 --> 02:28:32,820
伤心
sad...

2566
02:28:32,840 --> 02:28:34,670
或者为这些事烦恼
or confused about it.

2567
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:37,950
我不知道我想要什么
I don't know. I don't know what I wanted.

2568
02:28:37,970 --> 02:28:39,260
我只是
I wanted...

2569
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:41,270

I wanted to protect you.

2570

不要受你妈妈的影响
From all your mom's shit.

2571
02:28:46,150 --> 02:28:48,120
也别受我影响
From all my shit.

2572
02:28:49,330 --> 02:28:53,500
我大概只是想 当个好爸爸
I just, I suppose I wanted to be the one

2573
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:56,060
这样 你有困难的时候会来找我帮忙
that you came to for help, right?

2574
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:59,950
当一个很酷的爸爸
You know, the one, the cool dad

2575
02:28:59,970 --> 02:29:02,750
能让你敞开心扉
that you could say anything to.

2576
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:06,000
虽然我知道这是不可能的
Even though I know that's impossible.

2594
